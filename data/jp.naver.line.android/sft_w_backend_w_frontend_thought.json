You are responsible for backing it up yourself. /><9.2. Copyrights in the Submitted Contents belong to you or the copyright holder of such Contents. /><Among the Submitted Contents, with regard to those Submitted to the Services that can be accessed by unspecified or large number of Users, such as electronic bulletin boards, and those disclosed to other general Users, who are not your friends, in the Services such as the application “LINE” provided by us, you shall license (including, without limitation, a sublicensing right) us the right to use (including, without limitation, replication, screening, public transmission, exhibition, distribution, transfer, loan, translation, adaptation and publication) such Submitted Contents free of charge and non-exclusively, with indefinite duration within and outside of Japan. /><The Services may include functions where multiple Users may edit Contents (post, correct, and delete, etc.). In such case, a User who posted his/her Submitted Contents shall grant other Users the right to edit such Submitted Contents. /><Moreover, you shall not exercise rights such as author’s moral rights. /><9.3. If we acknowledge that you have violated, or may violate, laws and regulations or these Terms of Use in connection with the Submitted Contents, or when otherwise reasonably required for business, we may restrict the use of the Services, such as by deleting the Submitted Contents, without requiring any prior notice to you. /><9.4. We may check and confirm the contents of the Submitted Contents by Users to the extent permissible under laws and regulations, when it is necessary for us to confirm compliance with related laws and regulations or the provisions set out in these Terms, etc.; provided, however, that we are not obligated to conduct such confirmation. /><\n /><\n /><10. Message function using an electronic bulletin board, browsing thereof and right of deletion /><Certain Services provide a message exchanging function among Users by using the system of an electronic bulletin board. Certain electronic bulletin boards can only be browsed by the three parties of the sender of the message, recipient of the message, and us. In the foregoing case, we may browse the subject matter as needed and delete the message in light of these Terms of Use. /><\n /><\n /><11. User’s responsibility related to account and password, etc. /><When registering authentication information in using the Services, a User must strictly manage such authentication information under its own responsibility so that it will not be abused. If an operation is performed using the User’s authentication information that was registered (including without limitation cases where the User is authentication based on a combination of account and password, or based on a comparison of the code uniquely assigned for each mobile phone number sent from a mobile operator and the registered information), we will provide the Services by deeming that such operation is an act by the actual User. If Charges are incurred for the use of the Services or purchase of products as a result of a person other than the registered User performing operations using the User’s authentication information, we will bill such Charges to the User unless there was willful misconduct or negligence on our part. /><\n /><\n /><12.

Users shall supply PCs, mobile phone devices, smartphones and other communication devices, operating systems, communication methods and electricity, etc. necessary for using the Services at their own responsibility and expense. /><12.2.

Warranty of and modification to the Services /><13.1. With regard to the contents of the Services, we make no guarantee, whether express or implied, about the nonexistence of problems (including, without limitation, security-related defects, errors and bugs and infringement of rights), or about its security, reliability, accuracy, completeness, effectiveness and suitability for a particular purpose, and continuity of the provision of the Services. We are not obligated to provide the Services to you upon eliminating such problems. /><13.2. We may modify all or a part of the contents of the Services when corresponding to any of the following items: /><(1) when modification to the contents of the Services, such as addition of functions to or improvement of the Services, conforms to the general interests of Users; or /><(2) in cases other than the preceding item, there is rationality in light of the necessity to modify the contents of the Services, appropriateness of the contents after modification, and other circumstances concerning the modification. /><\n /><\n /><14. Prohibition of reuse of the Services, etc. /><Unless otherwise prescribed by us, you may not use the Services, or the data they consist of, for a purpose other than the purpose for which they are provided. If you do, we have the right to suspend such an act and charge you an amount equivalent to the profit or benefit you received from such an act. /><\n /><\n /><15.
