He had fertile lands, but because of his laziness, he cultivated crops only in a part of his land.\nOne night, it rained heavily and the roads turned muddy. Sinha was very happy that it had rained. He was to water the crops the next day. However, because of the heavy rain, he did not have to water them as the crops got sufficient water. However, he wanted to assess the status of his fields after the rain.\nHe also had two loads of hay to be sold at the market. Since the roads were muddy, he stayed at home.

Nevertheless, Sinha went to the market on a cart with horses. The road to the market was fairly good and he sold the hay. Then he took the country road and rode the cart towards his fields. But, the road was uneven and muddy with stagnant water.\nSinha drove very slowly to avoid getting dirty. Unfortunately, for Sinha, one wheel of the cart sank into the mire. He tried hard to move the cart and even pushed the horses to do so. The more he tried, the deeper the wheels sank into the mire.\nHe got down from the cart to look at the sunken wheel and searched all around for any help. However, help was hard to find, as people rarely took the country road, and all of them preferred the market road, which was much better.\nSinha started to curse himself for taking the bad road. Suddenly dark clouds appeared in the sky and it appeared that it was going to rain. Sinha lost his temper and started screaming, 'Hell, there is no one to help me'\".\nSuddenly, he heard a booming voice from the sky, \"Sinha, no one will help you unless you try to pull the wheel out by yourself.\nSinha then realized that he had done nothing to pull out the wheel from the mire. Sinha then removed the horses that were tied to the cart. He bent down and tried to pull out the wheel. After a few minutes of struggle, he gradually lifted the wheel from the mire. Supporting the cart with a shoulder, he pulled the wheel out. It was then Sinha understood that he succeeded, because he had tried.

Sammy was worried that due to aging, Dolly was gradually losing her hearing capacity.\nIt happened one day, when Sammy was in the living room and asked for a cup of tea from Dolly. Dolly did not respond. He increased his voice and once again asked her for some tea. Still, he heard nothing from Dolly. He got up and slowly walked to the kitchen and asked Dolly for some tea. Dolly was a bit surprised and said that she would bring it in 10 minutes.\nA few days after that incident, Sammy had to leave town for a week. After his return, he decided to find out the extent of his wife's hearing loss. He discussed this matter with a doctor, prior to taking Dolly to the doctor. The doctor told him an easy way to find the extent of her hearing loss.\nSammy reached home and called for his wife, Dolly as he entered. Dolly was in Kitchen, preparing dinner. He heard nothing from her. Then he asked her from the entrance door, 'Dolly what's for dinner?'\nSurprise! No response! All was silent.\nHe went to his room and asked her, 'I am here, what's for dinner Dolly?'\nHe sat on the sofa and asked her again, 'Dolly what's for dinner?' Again, it was silent...\nHe asked, her, 'What's for dinner' as he washed his face.\nHe then moved a few steps ahead towards kitchen and asked the same.\nHe tried with the question, 'What's for dinner' standing at different places at home to identify the extent of hearing loss.\nHe heard nothing from her. He then moved to kitchen and asked her, 'Dolly, what's for dinner?'\nDolly became furious at him and said, \"I am saying it for the eight time. It is chicken, can't you hear it?'\nSammy went speechless.\nSammy realized that one should not get into conclusions or blame others without knowing the truth.\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 1: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Moral Stories />\nRound 3: State: <Moral Stories /><1.

Days passed by and one day they were caught in a terrible storm and the ship was broken. Sinbad and two of the merchants were saved.\nAfter a while, they reached the Giants Land. One of the merchants was afraid. They all decided to take rest inside the cave. Suddenly, they heard a noise. A black fearful giant came. He was tall as a palm tree, and had only one eye placed in the center of him forehead. He was so frightful that the men could do nothing. He picked up the merchant who was the fattest and went away.\nSinbad and Hakim followed the giant. Soon they found the giant. The giant ate the man and went off to sleep. Sinbad and Hakim explored the place. It was the famous diamond valley. “Earlier, merchants used to come there to take the gems but now because of this giant no one dares to come here” ,Sinbad told Hakim. The giant was in a deep sleep. Suddenly, there appeared a man dressed in rags. He got scared on seeing Sinbad and Hakim. Sinbad told him that he would not harm him. A man told Sinbad that four years back, he came to this island looking for diamonds and this giant has got him as his prisoner now.\nSinbad asked him for help to get rid of this monster. He told everything what he knew. There was only one way to kill that monster. There was a sword inside the cave which was guided by a ferocious snake. Sinbad went inside and found a big snake lying around the sword. Sinbad took out his sword and killed it before even the snake could get up.\nHe took the sword and came out. The giant was snoring loudly and was sleeping. Sinbad went close and attacked with the sword into the giant’s eye. The giant died. Hakim and the man were very happy. They went out to find the way. There was plenty of wood available near the sea-shore. Everyone worked together and made small raft.Once it was ready, they all took the gems and set sail.\nAfter a few days at sea, they spotted a ship passing by. They all shouted for help. The ship came near and took them. Finally, they returned to Baghdad.

He ordered the Sheriff Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.\nOne day Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn’t notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood nor did he see that Little John and Robin Hood were watching him from the tree. \n“Look at all that gold, Hey Little John, let’s pay Prince John a little visit!”, said Robin Hood. In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject, Gold. “Life has become so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely and he missed out on all this lovely gold,” said Prince John.\nRobin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune tellers when the coach passed by. Prince John ordered to stop the coach. While Robin Hood told Price John’s fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the Prince’s gold. Prince John never ever knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John escaped. \nMeanwhile, the Sheriff of Nottingham was busy collecting taxes. He even took the coin that Mrs. Bunny had given her son, Skippy, for his birthday. The Sheriff had no heart. Robin Hood didn’t think little Skippy should go without presents on his birthday, so he gave his bow and arrow and his big hat as a gift.\nThe first time Skippy tried the bow, his arrow flew over Prince John’s castle wall. On the other side, he saw Maid Marian and Lady Kluck. Even though Marian was related to Prince John, she saw Robin’s friend. Long ago, they had been childhood sweethearts.\nOne day, Robin’s friend Friar Tuck, came to Sherwood Forest with some news. “Prince John is having an archery tomorrow. Maid Marian will kiss the winner.” Everyone knew that Robin Hood was the best archer in all of England. The next day two strangers appeared at the tournament, a Stork, and a Duke. “Nobody will recognize us in these disguises. I will win the tournament and the kiss, but no one will know the winner is Robin Hood,” said Robin Hood. \nSoon the Stork and the Sheriff were the only ones left in the contest. And even though Sheriff tried to cheat by having the target moved, the Stork made an amazing move and won. Prince John watched very closely. Robin Hood came to claim his prize but Prince John ordered his guards to seize him and gave him immediate death.\nBut suddenly, Little John grabbed Prince John and told him to free Robin Hood. Once Robin was free, a big fight began. Robin and Little John fought off the guards bravely. Swords clashed and the arrows flew! Maid Marian was almost seized by the guards but Robin somehow rescued her. He and his friends escaped into woods.\nSafely back in Sherwood Forest, all of them celebrated and Little John sang a song making fun of Prince John. It was so funny that soon all of Nottingham was singing it. On hearing it, Prince John became very angry and commanded to double the taxes. But of course, nobody could pay and the prisons were full. The Sheriff even robbed the church and arrested Friar for objecting.\nWhen Prince John heard that Friar Tuck was in jail, he planned a new trap for Robin Hood. “We’ll hang Friar in the morning and when Robin comes to the rescue, we’ll have him,” said Prince John. But Robin Hood was a foxy fellow and he was dressed up like a guard. He and Little John climbed the high castle wall and carefully stole the jail keys from the Sheriff who was sleeping. Everyone was surprised to see familiar faces and cried with joy.\nMeanwhile, Robin had climbed up into Prince John’s bedroom, where all the gold was kept. Prince John and Sir Hiss were sound asleep. Robin tied the bags of gold to a rope between the bedroom window and the jail. Suddenly Prince John awoke and saw there was no gold left. The courtyard became a jumble of arrows, guards and fleeing prisoners. When Robin’s hat bobbed to the surface of the moat, Prince John was overjoyed and thought that he was dead. But, Robin had escaped by diving in the moat. Even Little John thought that Robin had drowned.

He ordered the Sheriff Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.\nOne day Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn’t notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood nor did he see that Little John and Robin Hood were watching him from the tree. \n“Look at all that gold, Hey Little John, let’s pay Prince John a little visit!”, said Robin Hood. In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject, Gold. “Life has become so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely and he missed out on all this lovely gold,” said Prince John.\nRobin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune tellers when the coach passed by. Prince John ordered to stop the coach. While Robin Hood told Price John’s fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the Prince’s gold. Prince John never ever knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John escaped. \nMeanwhile, the Sheriff of Nottingham was busy collecting taxes. He even took the coin that Mrs. Bunny had given her son, Skippy, for his birthday. The Sheriff had no heart. Robin Hood didn’t think little Skippy should go without presents on his birthday, so he gave his bow and arrow and his big hat as a gift.\nThe first time Skippy tried the bow, his arrow flew over Prince John’s castle wall. On the other side, he saw Maid Marian and Lady Kluck. Even though Marian was related to Prince John, she saw Robin’s friend. Long ago, they had been childhood sweethearts.\nOne day, Robin’s friend Friar Tuck, came to Sherwood Forest with some news. “Prince John is having an archery tomorrow. Maid Marian will kiss the winner.” Everyone knew that Robin Hood was the best archer in all of England. The next day two strangers appeared at the tournament, a Stork, and a Duke. “Nobody will recognize us in these disguises. I will win the tournament and the kiss, but no one will know the winner is Robin Hood,” said Robin Hood. \nSoon the Stork and the Sheriff were the only ones left in the contest. And even though Sheriff tried to cheat by having the target moved, the Stork made an amazing move and won. Prince John watched very closely. Robin Hood came to claim his prize but Prince John ordered his guards to seize him and gave him immediate death.\nBut suddenly, Little John grabbed Prince John and told him to free Robin Hood. Once Robin was free, a big fight began. Robin and Little John fought off the guards bravely. Swords clashed and the arrows flew! Maid Marian was almost seized by the guards but Robin somehow rescued her. He and his friends escaped into woods.\nSafely back in Sherwood Forest, all of them celebrated and Little John sang a song making fun of Prince John. It was so funny that soon all of Nottingham was singing it. On hearing it, Prince John became very angry and commanded to double the taxes. But of course, nobody could pay and the prisons were full. The Sheriff even robbed the church and arrested Friar for objecting.\nWhen Prince John heard that Friar Tuck was in jail, he planned a new trap for Robin Hood. “We’ll hang Friar in the morning and when Robin comes to the rescue, we’ll have him,” said Prince John. But Robin Hood was a foxy fellow and he was dressed up like a guard. He and Little John climbed the high castle wall and carefully stole the jail keys from the Sheriff who was sleeping. Everyone was surprised to see familiar faces and cried with joy.\nMeanwhile, Robin had climbed up into Prince John’s bedroom, where all the gold was kept. Prince John and Sir Hiss were sound asleep. Robin tied the bags of gold to a rope between the bedroom window and the jail. Suddenly Prince John awoke and saw there was no gold left. The courtyard became a jumble of arrows, guards and fleeing prisoners. When Robin’s hat bobbed to the surface of the moat, Prince John was overjoyed and thought that he was dead. But, Robin had escaped by diving in the moat. Even Little John thought that Robin had drowned. But suddenly, Little John saw Robin and was overjoyed.\nSoon after Robin’s narrow escape, good King Richard narrow came back from the Crusades to take his place on the throne of England.

He ordered the Sheriff Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.\nOne day Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn’t notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood nor did he see that Little John and Robin Hood were watching him from the tree. \n“Look at all that gold, Hey Little John, let’s pay Prince John a little visit!”, said Robin Hood. In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject, Gold. “Life has become so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely and he missed out on all this lovely gold,” said Prince John.\nRobin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune tellers when the coach passed by. Prince John ordered to stop the coach. While Robin Hood told Price John’s fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the Prince’s gold. Prince John never ever knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John escaped. \nMeanwhile, the Sheriff of Nottingham was busy collecting taxes. He even took the coin that Mrs. Bunny had given her son, Skippy, for his birthday. The Sheriff had no heart. Robin Hood didn’t think little Skippy should go without presents on his birthday, so he gave his bow and arrow and his big hat as a gift.\nThe first time Skippy tried the bow, his arrow flew over Prince John’s castle wall. On the other side, he saw Maid Marian and Lady Kluck. Even though Marian was related to Prince John, she saw Robin’s friend. Long ago, they had been childhood sweethearts.\nOne day, Robin’s friend Friar Tuck, came to Sherwood Forest with some news. “Prince John is having an archery tomorrow. Maid Marian will kiss the winner.” Everyone knew that Robin Hood was the best archer in all of England. The next day two strangers appeared at the tournament, a Stork, and a Duke. “Nobody will recognize us in these disguises. I will win the tournament and the kiss, but no one will know the winner is Robin Hood,” said Robin Hood. \nSoon the Stork and the Sheriff were the only ones left in the contest. And even though Sheriff tried to cheat by having the target moved, the Stork made an amazing move and won. Prince John watched very closely. Robin Hood came to claim his prize but Prince John ordered his guards to seize him and gave him immediate death.\nBut suddenly, Little John grabbed Prince John and told him to free Robin Hood. Once Robin was free, a big fight began. Robin and Little John fought off the guards bravely. Swords clashed and the arrows flew! Maid Marian was almost seized by the guards but Robin somehow rescued her. He and his friends escaped into woods.\nSafely back in Sherwood Forest, all of them celebrated and Little John sang a song making fun of Prince John. It was so funny that soon all of Nottingham was singing it. On hearing it, Prince John became very angry and commanded to double the taxes. But of course, nobody could pay and the prisons were full. The Sheriff even robbed the church and arrested Friar for objecting.\nWhen Prince John heard that Friar Tuck was in jail, he planned a new trap for Robin Hood. “We’ll hang Friar in the morning and when Robin comes to the rescue, we’ll have him,” said Prince John. But Robin Hood was a foxy fellow and he was dressed up like a guard. He and Little John climbed the high castle wall and carefully stole the jail keys from the Sheriff who was sleeping. Everyone was surprised to see familiar faces and cried with joy.\nMeanwhile, Robin had climbed up into Prince John’s bedroom, where all the gold was kept. Prince John and Sir Hiss were sound asleep. Robin tied the bags of gold to a rope between the bedroom window and the jail. Suddenly Prince John awoke and saw there was no gold left. The courtyard became a jumble of arrows, guards and fleeing prisoners. When Robin’s hat bobbed to the surface of the moat, Prince John was overjoyed and thought that he was dead. But, Robin had escaped by diving in the moat. Even Little John thought that Robin had drowned. But suddenly, Little John saw Robin and was overjoyed.\nSoon after Robin’s narrow escape, good King Richard narrow came back from the Crusades to take his place on the throne of England. Happiness returned to the land. Robin Hood and Maid Marian were married and all their friends came to wish them all.  />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 4: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Classic Stories />\n\nCurrent Database: {'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: This action involves navigating the frontend UI and the backend database does not need to be updated since no specific data is altered or saved based on this interaction.\nBackend Action: pass\n"}], "idx": 44}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next state of the application given the previous state-action history, and the result of the backend action.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nNext State: (your predicted next state)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: English Stories :Short Stories\nApp Description: A collection of English-language short stories for learners, helping users improve their reading skills while enjoying engaging tales.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 1: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Adventure Tales />\nRound 2: State: <Adventure Tales /><1.

They wished to bless a family and provide them with enough wealth and happiness. The angels disguised themselves as two girls who were pale and dull in appearance.\nThey picked two houses.

The girls requested the house owner of the big house to let them stay at their house just for one night as the night was too cold and frightening.\nThe house owner was too rude.

She repaired the damaged wall with her magic and covered the space.\nThe second angel was surprised! They left home the next morning.\nNext was the second home chosen by the angels. The house was very compact and located at one corner of the town. The angels asked the woman who opened the door if they can get accommodation for the night.\nThey were cordially invited. The house owner asked them to stay at their room for the night, as they looked very tired. The couple offered them food and they slept peacefully.\nThe next morning they heard that the couple's cow had died. The woman was crying and the man looked extremely worried, as the cow was the main breadwinner for the family. They lived on selling their cow's milk.\nThe second angel was very angry, as the first angel had killed the cow. When they argued, the first angel told her, 'I repaired the wall's hollow in the big mansion! The space had a hidden treasure; however, no member in that family was good at heart and they did not deserve it! That is why I closed their treasure. It was not I who killed the cow, but I transferred the death to the cow. Death was approaching the woman and the man who offered their shelter and food to us.\nHowever, don't worry!

He ordered the Sheriff Nottingham to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and Little John, who would steal the tax money from the Sheriff and give it back to the poor.\nOne day Prince John was traveling by coach to Nottingham to pick up more tax money. He was so busy counting his gold that he didn’t notice he was passing through Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood nor did he see that Little John and Robin Hood were watching him from the tree. \n“Look at all that gold, Hey Little John, let’s pay Prince John a little visit!”, said Robin Hood. In his coach, Prince John was talking to his counselor, Sir Hiss, about his favorite subject, Gold. “Life has become so wonderful since King Richard left for the Crusades. He treated the people too nicely and he missed out on all this lovely gold,” said Prince John.\nRobin Hood and Little John were standing by the roadside disguised as lady fortune tellers when the coach passed by. Prince John ordered to stop the coach. While Robin Hood told Price John’s fortune, he slipped the royal rings off his fingers, and Little John helped himself to the Prince’s gold. Prince John never ever knew he had been robbed until Robin and Little John escaped. \nMeanwhile, the Sheriff of Nottingham was busy collecting taxes. He even took the coin that Mrs. Bunny had given her son, Skippy, for his birthday. The Sheriff had no heart. Robin Hood didn’t think little Skippy should go without presents on his birthday, so he gave his bow and arrow and his big hat as a gift.\nThe first time Skippy tried the bow, his arrow flew over Prince John’s castle wall. On the other side, he saw Maid Marian and Lady Kluck. Even though Marian was related to Prince John, she saw Robin’s friend. Long ago, they had been childhood sweethearts.\nOne day, Robin’s friend Friar Tuck, came to Sherwood Forest with some news. “Prince John is having an archery tomorrow. Maid Marian will kiss the winner.” Everyone knew that Robin Hood was the best archer in all of England. The next day two strangers appeared at the tournament, a Stork, and a Duke. “Nobody will recognize us in these disguises. I will win the tournament and the kiss, but no one will know the winner is Robin Hood,” said Robin Hood. \nSoon the Stork and the Sheriff were the only ones left in the contest. And even though Sheriff tried to cheat by having the target moved, the Stork made an amazing move and won. Prince John watched very closely. Robin Hood came to claim his prize but Prince John ordered his guards to seize him and gave him immediate death.\nBut suddenly, Little John grabbed Prince John and told him to free Robin Hood. Once Robin was free, a big fight began. Robin and Little John fought off the guards bravely. Swords clashed and the arrows flew! Maid Marian was almost seized by the guards but Robin somehow rescued her. He and his friends escaped into woods.\nSafely back in Sherwood Forest, all of them celebrated and Little John sang a song making fun of Prince John.

The rat was kind; however, he would always bargain for just about anything. One day while walking along the road, he found a broken branch lying under a tree. The rat put it in his bag to use it for his furnace in winter.\nHe continued his journey and came across a poor old man trying to light a fire. Around the man, were three little girls who were crying. The shrewd rat immediately offered his help to the old man.\nThe old man who mistook the rat's intents replied, \"Of course you can help. My children are hungry and the wood is wet. I cannot build a fire to cook their meager breakfast.\"\nThe rat said, \"I have some dry branches, which you can use it to make a fine blaze.\"\nThe thankful old man offered the rat some dough in return. The shrewd rat was happy that he got a week's supply of dough for a dry branch.\nHe carried on his journey and entered a pottery maker's yard. There he found two boys crying.\nThe rat comforted them and asked, \"What is your problem? Perhaps, I can help you.\"\nThe elder boy stopped crying and said, \"Our parents have gone to the village. They went to get some food and haven't returned, and we are hungry.\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, take this dough, and bake it. Soon you will have bread to eat.\"\nThe children thanked the rat and offered a pot made by their father. They said, \"We will not forget your kindness.\"\nThe proud rat tottered off with the pot. It was heavy, but the rat was happy at his shrewdness. He thought the exchange for the flour was a good deal.\nHe continued his journey and came across a farmer, milking a cow. Since he did not have pale, he was draining the milk into his shoes.\nThe rat said, \"You are making your milk dirty, by draining it in to your shoes. It would be better if you had a pale or a pot.\" Saying so, he offered the farmer his pot.\nThe farmer offered the rat some milk to drink in return. However, the rat refused it and said, \"I need a better bargain. Perhaps, you ought to give me a cow.\"\nThe farmed laughed at the rat's suggestion and said, \"You are a little animal. What will you do with this cow?\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, that's my problem. I will learn to handle the cow.\" Therefore, the farmer tied the cow's rein around the rat's neck.\nThe rat walked a few yards in a cocky manner and soon realized the rope was choking him. As the cow had stopped to graze, the rat had no choice but to wait. He thought, as the cow was his property; he ought to take good care of the cow. Therefore, he thought that he should follow the cow.\nThe whole day went by. The cow moved from one spot to another and the rat struggled to catch up. Finally, at dusk, the cow stopped by the river and rested. The weary rat gratefully sat beside him.\nVery soon, a wedding procession passed by and stopped to rest beside the stream. Four men were carrying the bride in a palanquin. They stopped by, and began cooking some rice, as that was all they had.\nThe rat seeing the predicament of the hungry bearers thought of another plan. He offered his cow to the four palanquin bearers as their supper. They laughed at the suggestion, but eventually agreed, as they were hungry. Soon, they had a huge steak, and offered a tiny piece to the rat.\nThe rat became angry at their offer. He explained to them about how he got the cow. He then added, \"Therefore, I will take nothing less than the bride herself.\"\nThe bearers realized their mistake and fled. The rat went up to the palanquin and lifted the curtain. He then told the lovely bride, \"My dear, you are mine and I shall look after you.\"\nThe girl giggled and followed the rat, as she was alone and frightened. They reached the rat's hole and the rat invited her to his home. Obviously, she could not get in, as the hole was tiny. Therefore, the rat said, \"Tomorrow, I shall make the hole larger. Until then, you can sleep under that plum tree.\"\nThe bride complained, \"I cannot sleep as I am hungry.\" The rat grumbling that all brides were a pain, went into his hole and came with a plum.\nThe girl looked in awe at the plum. She then said, \"You expect me to daily cook, clean the house and do other jobs for just a plum?\"\nThe rat shook his head in disbelief. He had not expected this from his new wife. He said, \"Tomorrow, I shall get you some delicacies from the market.\"\nThe next day, the mouse and the girl went to the market. They reached the palace, and there was the bride's mother, the queen waiting for at the gates. Thrilled, the queen and daughter embraced each other. The rat was fuming all this time. He told the queen, \"She is my wife now. I traded a cow for her, so she belongs to me.\"\nThe wise queen could scarcely hold back her laughter. She said, \"My dear son-in-law, we have been waiting for you. We have prepared a special room for you.\"\nDelighted, the rat followed the queen. The queen took him to the oven and asked him to go in. The rat leaped inside and \"bang,\" the oven door shut. He sat there fuming, while the queen and daughter were laughing uncontrollably.\nSoon the temperature became hotter and the rat's tail caught fire. He cried out loud, \"Please let me out; I shall never make a bargain again.\"\nOn hearing this, they let him out. He ran, his head hung in shame. The rat had learned his lesson. He never, never made another bargain.\nMessage: The rat thought that it was a clever rat indeed, but all his clever bargaining was only greed.\nMoral: Never try to push your good chances too far, or you may lose what you have.\n />\n"}], "idx": 55}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: English Stories :Short Stories\nApp Description: A collection of English-language short stories for learners, helping users improve their reading skills while enjoying engaging tales.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Classic Stories /><1.

It was so cold and too small for them.\nThe angels thanked them and stayed at the basement. One angel saw a hollow and a part of the wall broken. She repaired the damaged wall with her magic and covered the space.\nThe second angel was surprised! They left home the next morning.\nNext was the second home chosen by the angels. The house was very compact and located at one corner of the town. The angels asked the woman who opened the door if they can get accommodation for the night.\nThey were cordially invited. The house owner asked them to stay at their room for the night, as they looked very tired. The couple offered them food and they slept peacefully.\nThe next morning they heard that the couple's cow had died. The woman was crying and the man looked extremely worried, as the cow was the main breadwinner for the family. They lived on selling their cow's milk.\nThe second angel was very angry, as the first angel had killed the cow. When they argued, the first angel told her, 'I repaired the wall's hollow in the big mansion! The space had a hidden treasure; however, no member in that family was good at heart and they did not deserve it! That is why I closed their treasure. It was not I who killed the cow, but I transferred the death to the cow. Death was approaching the woman and the man who offered their shelter and food to us.\nHowever, don't worry! I have provided them with a pot full of gold coins. They will find that treasure some day and will make good use of it!'\nEverything has two sides.

The rat was kind; however, he would always bargain for just about anything. One day while walking along the road, he found a broken branch lying under a tree. The rat put it in his bag to use it for his furnace in winter.\nHe continued his journey and came across a poor old man trying to light a fire. Around the man, were three little girls who were crying. The shrewd rat immediately offered his help to the old man.\nThe old man who mistook the rat's intents replied, \"Of course you can help. My children are hungry and the wood is wet. I cannot build a fire to cook their meager breakfast.\"\nThe rat said, \"I have some dry branches, which you can use it to make a fine blaze.\"\nThe thankful old man offered the rat some dough in return. The shrewd rat was happy that he got a week's supply of dough for a dry branch.\nHe carried on his journey and entered a pottery maker's yard. There he found two boys crying.\nThe rat comforted them and asked, \"What is your problem? Perhaps, I can help you.\"\nThe elder boy stopped crying and said, \"Our parents have gone to the village. They went to get some food and haven't returned, and we are hungry.\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, take this dough, and bake it. Soon you will have bread to eat.\"\nThe children thanked the rat and offered a pot made by their father. They said, \"We will not forget your kindness.\"\nThe proud rat tottered off with the pot. It was heavy, but the rat was happy at his shrewdness. He thought the exchange for the flour was a good deal.\nHe continued his journey and came across a farmer, milking a cow. Since he did not have pale, he was draining the milk into his shoes.\nThe rat said, \"You are making your milk dirty, by draining it in to your shoes. It would be better if you had a pale or a pot.\" Saying so, he offered the farmer his pot.\nThe farmer offered the rat some milk to drink in return. However, the rat refused it and said, \"I need a better bargain. Perhaps, you ought to give me a cow.\"\nThe farmed laughed at the rat's suggestion and said, \"You are a little animal. What will you do with this cow?\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, that's my problem. I will learn to handle the cow.\" Therefore, the farmer tied the cow's rein around the rat's neck.\nThe rat walked a few yards in a cocky manner and soon realized the rope was choking him. As the cow had stopped to graze, the rat had no choice but to wait. He thought, as the cow was his property; he ought to take good care of the cow. Therefore, he thought that he should follow the cow.\nThe whole day went by. The cow moved from one spot to another and the rat struggled to catch up. Finally, at dusk, the cow stopped by the river and rested. The weary rat gratefully sat beside him.\nVery soon, a wedding procession passed by and stopped to rest beside the stream. Four men were carrying the bride in a palanquin. They stopped by, and began cooking some rice, as that was all they had.\nThe rat seeing the predicament of the hungry bearers thought of another plan. He offered his cow to the four palanquin bearers as their supper. They laughed at the suggestion, but eventually agreed, as they were hungry. Soon, they had a huge steak, and offered a tiny piece to the rat.\nThe rat became angry at their offer. He explained to them about how he got the cow. He then added, \"Therefore, I will take nothing less than the bride herself.\"\nThe bearers realized their mistake and fled. The rat went up to the palanquin and lifted the curtain. He then told the lovely bride, \"My dear, you are mine and I shall look after you.\"\nThe girl giggled and followed the rat, as she was alone and frightened. They reached the rat's hole and the rat invited her to his home. Obviously, she could not get in, as the hole was tiny. Therefore, the rat said, \"Tomorrow, I shall make the hole larger. Until then, you can sleep under that plum tree.\"\nThe bride complained, \"I cannot sleep as I am hungry.\" The rat grumbling that all brides were a pain, went into his hole and came with a plum.\nThe girl looked in awe at the plum. She then said, \"You expect me to daily cook, clean the house and do other jobs for just a plum?\"\nThe rat shook his head in disbelief. He had not expected this from his new wife. He said, \"Tomorrow, I shall get you some delicacies from the market.\"\nThe next day, the mouse and the girl went to the market. They reached the palace, and there was the bride's mother, the queen waiting for at the gates. Thrilled, the queen and daughter embraced each other. The rat was fuming all this time. He told the queen, \"She is my wife now. I traded a cow for her, so she belongs to me.\"\nThe wise queen could scarcely hold back her laughter. She said, \"My dear son-in-law, we have been waiting for you. We have prepared a special room for you.\"\nDelighted, the rat followed the queen. The queen took him to the oven and asked him to go in. The rat leaped inside and \"bang,\" the oven door shut. He sat there fuming, while the queen and daughter were laughing uncontrollably.\nSoon the temperature became hotter and the rat's tail caught fire. He cried out loud, \"Please let me out; I shall never make a bargain again.\"\nOn hearing this, they let him out. He ran, his head hung in shame. The rat had learned his lesson. He never, never made another bargain.\nMessage: The rat thought that it was a clever rat indeed, but all his clever bargaining was only greed.\nMoral: Never try to push your good chances too far, or you may lose what you have.\n />\n Action: kill_app\n\nThe backend action of the last step:\ndatabase['reading_list'].append({'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'})\nThe execution result of the backend action:\n{'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'}]}\nPlease now give the next state:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nNext State: <Apps list /><Search />\n"}], "idx": 57}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: English Stories :Short Stories\nApp Description: A collection of English-language short stories for learners, helping users improve their reading skills while enjoying engaging tales.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <The Difference /><The Difference /><Two angels decided to visit a town.

Four men were carrying the bride in a palanquin. They stopped by, and began cooking some rice, as that was all they had.\nThe rat seeing the predicament of the hungry bearers thought of another plan. He offered his cow to the four palanquin bearers as their supper. They laughed at the suggestion, but eventually agreed, as they were hungry. Soon, they had a huge steak, and offered a tiny piece to the rat.\nThe rat became angry at their offer. He explained to them about how he got the cow. He then added, \"Therefore, I will take nothing less than the bride herself.\"\nThe bearers realized their mistake and fled. The rat went up to the palanquin and lifted the curtain. He then told the lovely bride, \"My dear, you are mine and I shall look after you.\"\nThe girl giggled and followed the rat, as she was alone and frightened. They reached the rat's hole and the rat invited her to his home. Obviously, she could not get in, as the hole was tiny. Therefore, the rat said, \"Tomorrow, I shall make the hole larger. Until then, you can sleep under that plum tree.\"\nThe bride complained, \"I cannot sleep as I am hungry.\" The rat grumbling that all brides were a pain, went into his hole and came with a plum.\nThe girl looked in awe at the plum. She then said, \"You expect me to daily cook, clean the house and do other jobs for just a plum?\"\nThe rat shook his head in disbelief. He had not expected this from his new wife. He said, \"Tomorrow, I shall get you some delicacies from the market.\"\nThe next day, the mouse and the girl went to the market. They reached the palace, and there was the bride's mother, the queen waiting for at the gates. Thrilled, the queen and daughter embraced each other. The rat was fuming all this time. He told the queen, \"She is my wife now. I traded a cow for her, so she belongs to me.\"\nThe wise queen could scarcely hold back her laughter. She said, \"My dear son-in-law, we have been waiting for you. We have prepared a special room for you.\"\nDelighted, the rat followed the queen. The queen took him to the oven and asked him to go in. The rat leaped inside and \"bang,\" the oven door shut. He sat there fuming, while the queen and daughter were laughing uncontrollably.\nSoon the temperature became hotter and the rat's tail caught fire. He cried out loud, \"Please let me out; I shall never make a bargain again.\"\nOn hearing this, they let him out. He ran, his head hung in shame. The rat had learned his lesson. He never, never made another bargain.\nMessage: The rat thought that it was a clever rat indeed, but all his clever bargaining was only greed.\nMoral: Never try to push your good chances too far, or you may lose what you have.\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 4: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Animal Stories />\n\nCurrent Database: {'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: This action is navigating through the story categories in the application and involves no modification, addition, or deletion of data in the database.

The rat was kind; however, he would always bargain for just about anything. One day while walking along the road, he found a broken branch lying under a tree. The rat put it in his bag to use it for his furnace in winter.\nHe continued his journey and came across a poor old man trying to light a fire. Around the man, were three little girls who were crying. The shrewd rat immediately offered his help to the old man.\nThe old man who mistook the rat's intents replied, \"Of course you can help. My children are hungry and the wood is wet. I cannot build a fire to cook their meager breakfast.\"\nThe rat said, \"I have some dry branches, which you can use it to make a fine blaze.\"\nThe thankful old man offered the rat some dough in return. The shrewd rat was happy that he got a week's supply of dough for a dry branch.\nHe carried on his journey and entered a pottery maker's yard. There he found two boys crying.\nThe rat comforted them and asked, \"What is your problem? Perhaps, I can help you.\"\nThe elder boy stopped crying and said, \"Our parents have gone to the village. They went to get some food and haven't returned, and we are hungry.\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, take this dough, and bake it. Soon you will have bread to eat.\"\nThe children thanked the rat and offered a pot made by their father. They said, \"We will not forget your kindness.\"\nThe proud rat tottered off with the pot. It was heavy, but the rat was happy at his shrewdness. He thought the exchange for the flour was a good deal.\nHe continued his journey and came across a farmer, milking a cow. Since he did not have pale, he was draining the milk into his shoes.\nThe rat said, \"You are making your milk dirty, by draining it in to your shoes. It would be better if you had a pale or a pot.\" Saying so, he offered the farmer his pot.\nThe farmer offered the rat some milk to drink in return. However, the rat refused it and said, \"I need a better bargain. Perhaps, you ought to give me a cow.\"\nThe farmed laughed at the rat's suggestion and said, \"You are a little animal. What will you do with this cow?\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, that's my problem. I will learn to handle the cow.\" Therefore, the farmer tied the cow's rein around the rat's neck.\nThe rat walked a few yards in a cocky manner and soon realized the rope was choking him. As the cow had stopped to graze, the rat had no choice but to wait. He thought, as the cow was his property; he ought to take good care of the cow.

They had grown up together to become good friends. Satyanand, Vidhyanand and Dharmanand were very knowledgeable. But Sivanand spent most of his time eating and sleeping. He was considered foolish by everyone.\nOnce famine struck the village. All the crops failed. Rivers and lakes started to dry up. The people of the villages started moving to other villages to save their lives.\n\"We also need to move to another place soon or else we will also die like many others,\" said Satyanand. They all agreed with him.\n\"But what about Sivanand?\" Asked Satyanand.\n\"Do we need him with us? He has no skills or learning. We cannot take him with us,\" replied Dharmanand. \"He will be a burden on us.\"\n\"How can we leave him behind? He grew up with us,\" said Vidhyanand. \"We will share what ever we earn equally among the four of us.\"\nThey all agreed to take Sivanand along with them.\nThey packed all necessary things and set out for a nearby town. On the way, they had to cross a forest.\nAs they were walking through the forest, they came across the bones of an animal. They became curious and stopped to take a closer look at the bones.\n\"Those are the bones of a lion,\" said Vidhyanand.\nThe others agreed.\n\"This is a great opportunity to test our learning,\" said Satyanand.\n\"I can put the bones together.\" So saying, he brought the bones together to form the skeleton of a lion.\n\"Dharmanand said, \"I can put muscles and tissue on it.\" Soon a lifeless lion lay before them.\n\"I can breathe life into that body.\" said Vidhyanand.\nBut before he could continue, Sivanand jumped up to stop him. \"No. Don't! If you put life into that lion, it will kill us all,\" he cried.\n\"Oh you coward! You can't stop me from testing my skills and learning,\" shouted an angry Vidhyanand. \"You are here with us only because I requested the others to let you come along.\"\n\"Then please let me climb that tree first,' said a frightened Sivanand running towards the nearest tree. Just as Sivanand pulled himself on to the tallest branch of the tree Vidhyanand brought life into the lion. Getting up with a deafening roar, the lion attacked and killed the three learned Brahmins.\n />\n"}], "idx": 63}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: English Stories :Short Stories\nApp Description: A collection of English-language short stories for learners, helping users improve their reading skills while enjoying engaging tales.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Bedtime Stories /><1.

Soon you will have bread to eat.\"\nThe children thanked the rat and offered a pot made by their father. They said, \"We will not forget your kindness.\"\nThe proud rat tottered off with the pot. It was heavy, but the rat was happy at his shrewdness. He thought the exchange for the flour was a good deal.\nHe continued his journey and came across a farmer, milking a cow. Since he did not have pale, he was draining the milk into his shoes.\nThe rat said, \"You are making your milk dirty, by draining it in to your shoes. It would be better if you had a pale or a pot.\" Saying so, he offered the farmer his pot.\nThe farmer offered the rat some milk to drink in return. However, the rat refused it and said, \"I need a better bargain. Perhaps, you ought to give me a cow.\"\nThe farmed laughed at the rat's suggestion and said, \"You are a little animal. What will you do with this cow?\"\nThe rat said, \"Well, that's my problem. I will learn to handle the cow.\" Therefore, the farmer tied the cow's rein around the rat's neck.\nThe rat walked a few yards in a cocky manner and soon realized the rope was choking him. As the cow had stopped to graze, the rat had no choice but to wait. He thought, as the cow was his property; he ought to take good care of the cow. Therefore, he thought that he should follow the cow.\nThe whole day went by. The cow moved from one spot to another and the rat struggled to catch up. Finally, at dusk, the cow stopped by the river and rested. The weary rat gratefully sat beside him.\nVery soon, a wedding procession passed by and stopped to rest beside the stream. Four men were carrying the bride in a palanquin. They stopped by, and began cooking some rice, as that was all they had.\nThe rat seeing the predicament of the hungry bearers thought of another plan. He offered his cow to the four palanquin bearers as their supper. They laughed at the suggestion, but eventually agreed, as they were hungry. Soon, they had a huge steak, and offered a tiny piece to the rat.\nThe rat became angry at their offer. He explained to them about how he got the cow. He then added, \"Therefore, I will take nothing less than the bride herself.\"\nThe bearers realized their mistake and fled. The rat went up to the palanquin and lifted the curtain. He then told the lovely bride, \"My dear, you are mine and I shall look after you.\"\nThe girl giggled and followed the rat, as she was alone and frightened. They reached the rat's hole and the rat invited her to his home. Obviously, she could not get in, as the hole was tiny. Therefore, the rat said, \"Tomorrow, I shall make the hole larger. Until then, you can sleep under that plum tree.\"\nThe bride complained, \"I cannot sleep as I am hungry.\" The rat grumbling that all brides were a pain, went into his hole and came with a plum.\nThe girl looked in awe at the plum. She then said, \"You expect me to daily cook, clean the house and do other jobs for just a plum?\"\nThe rat shook his head in disbelief. He had not expected this from his new wife. He said, \"Tomorrow, I shall get you some delicacies from the market.\"\nThe next day, the mouse and the girl went to the market. They reached the palace, and there was the bride's mother, the queen waiting for at the gates. Thrilled, the queen and daughter embraced each other. The rat was fuming all this time. He told the queen, \"She is my wife now. I traded a cow for her, so she belongs to me.\"\nThe wise queen could scarcely hold back her laughter. She said, \"My dear son-in-law, we have been waiting for you. We have prepared a special room for you.\"\nDelighted, the rat followed the queen. The queen took him to the oven and asked him to go in. The rat leaped inside and \"bang,\" the oven door shut. He sat there fuming, while the queen and daughter were laughing uncontrollably.\nSoon the temperature became hotter and the rat's tail caught fire. He cried out loud, \"Please let me out; I shall never make a bargain again.\"\nOn hearing this, they let him out. He ran, his head hung in shame. The rat had learned his lesson. He never, never made another bargain.\nMessage: The rat thought that it was a clever rat indeed, but all his clever bargaining was only greed.\nMoral: Never try to push your good chances too far, or you may lose what you have.\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 2: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 3: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Animal Stories />\nRound 4: State: <Animal Stories /><1.

They had grown up together to become good friends. Satyanand, Vidhyanand and Dharmanand were very knowledgeable. But Sivanand spent most of his time eating and sleeping. He was considered foolish by everyone.\nOnce famine struck the village. All the crops failed. Rivers and lakes started to dry up. The people of the villages started moving to other villages to save their lives.\n\"We also need to move to another place soon or else we will also die like many others,\" said Satyanand. They all agreed with him.\n\"But what about Sivanand?\" Asked Satyanand.\n\"Do we need him with us? He has no skills or learning. We cannot take him with us,\" replied Dharmanand. \"He will be a burden on us.\"\n\"How can we leave him behind? He grew up with us,\" said Vidhyanand. \"We will share what ever we earn equally among the four of us.\"\nThey all agreed to take Sivanand along with them.\nThey packed all necessary things and set out for a nearby town. On the way, they had to cross a forest.\nAs they were walking through the forest, they came across the bones of an animal. They became curious and stopped to take a closer look at the bones.\n\"Those are the bones of a lion,\" said Vidhyanand.\nThe others agreed.\n\"This is a great opportunity to test our learning,\" said Satyanand.\n\"I can put the bones together.\" So saying, he brought the bones together to form the skeleton of a lion.\n\"Dharmanand said, \"I can put muscles and tissue on it.\" Soon a lifeless lion lay before them.\n\"I can breathe life into that body.\" said Vidhyanand.\nBut before he could continue, Sivanand jumped up to stop him. \"No. Don't! If you put life into that lion, it will kill us all,\" he cried.\n\"Oh you coward! You can't stop me from testing my skills and learning,\" shouted an angry Vidhyanand. \"You are here with us only because I requested the others to let you come along.\"\n\"Then please let me climb that tree first,' said a frightened Sivanand running towards the nearest tree. Just as Sivanand pulled himself on to the tallest branch of the tree Vidhyanand brought life into the lion.

The rat was kind; however, he would always bargain for just about anything. One day while walking along the road, he found a broken branch lying under a tree. The rat put it in his bag to use it for his furnace in winter.\nHe continued his journey and came across a poor old man trying to light a fire. Around the man, were three little girls who were crying. The shrewd rat immediately offered his help to the old man.\nThe old man who mistook the rat's intents replied, \"Of course you can help. My children are hungry and the wood is wet. I cannot build a fire to cook their meager breakfast.\"\nThe rat said, \"I have some dry branches, which you can use it to make a fine blaze.\"\nThe thankful old man offered the rat some dough in return.

He then told the lovely bride, \"My dear, you are mine and I shall look after you.\"\nThe girl giggled and followed the rat, as she was alone and frightened. They reached the rat's hole and the rat invited her to his home. Obviously, she could not get in, as the hole was tiny. Therefore, the rat said, \"Tomorrow, I shall make the hole larger. Until then, you can sleep under that plum tree.\"\nThe bride complained, \"I cannot sleep as I am hungry.\" The rat grumbling that all brides were a pain, went into his hole and came with a plum.\nThe girl looked in awe at the plum. She then said, \"You expect me to daily cook, clean the house and do other jobs for just a plum?\"\nThe rat shook his head in disbelief. He had not expected this from his new wife. He said, \"Tomorrow, I shall get you some delicacies from the market.\"\nThe next day, the mouse and the girl went to the market. They reached the palace, and there was the bride's mother, the queen waiting for at the gates. Thrilled, the queen and daughter embraced each other. The rat was fuming all this time. He told the queen, \"She is my wife now. I traded a cow for her, so she belongs to me.\"\nThe wise queen could scarcely hold back her laughter. She said, \"My dear son-in-law, we have been waiting for you. We have prepared a special room for you.\"\nDelighted, the rat followed the queen. The queen took him to the oven and asked him to go in. The rat leaped inside and \"bang,\" the oven door shut. He sat there fuming, while the queen and daughter were laughing uncontrollably.\nSoon the temperature became hotter and the rat's tail caught fire. He cried out loud, \"Please let me out; I shall never make a bargain again.\"\nOn hearing this, they let him out. He ran, his head hung in shame. The rat had learned his lesson. He never, never made another bargain.\nMessage: The rat thought that it was a clever rat indeed, but all his clever bargaining was only greed.\nMoral: Never try to push your good chances too far, or you may lose what you have.\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 1: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Animal Stories />\nRound 3: State: <Animal Stories /><1.

As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them. Because of this, most of the plants lost their roots in this process and started drying up.\nThe next day, the landlord came out for a stroll in his favorite garden, and noticed that all his plants had been uprooted, and that they were drying up.

After several weeks of buying a pound of butter from the farmer, the baker decided to weigh the butter that he was receiving to ensure it was indeed a full pound. When the baker weighed it, he learned that the butter was under a pound, which enraged him. He felt he was being cheated and he decided to take the farmer to court.\nWhen in court, the judge asked the farmer how he was weighing the butter. The farmer said, “Your Honor, I am poor. I do not own an exact measuring tool. However, I do have a scale.”\nThe judge then asked if the farmer uses the scale to measure the butter.\nThe farmer said, “Your Honor, I have been buying a one-pound loaf of bread from the baker since long before he began purchasing butter from me. Whenever the baker brings bread for me, I put it on the scale and then measure out the exact same weight in butter to give him in return. So, if the baker is not getting a pound of butter, he is also not giving a pound of bread like he promised.”\nThe Moral:\nYou get what you give. If you try to cheat others out of what you promise them, you will be cheated in return. The more honest you are, the easier it is to trust other people and not suspect they may be cheating you in some way. When you’re honest, not only will other people trust you, but you will also feel more confident in your trust with others. Honesty is always the best route–especially if you want others to be honest with you as well. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 1: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Bedtime Stories />\nRound 3: State: <Bedtime Stories /><1.

As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots.

He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them. Because of this, most of the plants lost their roots in this process and started drying up.\nThe next day, the landlord came out for a stroll in his favorite garden, and noticed that all his plants had been uprooted, and that they were drying up. He immediately summoned for the gardener. The frightened gardener told the landlord what had happened, and this made the landlord very angry and he immediately dismissed the gardener from his job.\nAs a result of his foolish act, the gardener lost his job!\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 1: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Adventure Tales />\nRound 3: State: <Adventure Tales /><1.

As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\".

It always went about, anywhere that anyone pulled it, on four wooden wheels, carrying a foolish knight, who wore a large cocked hat and a long cloak, because he had no legs. Now, a man who has no legs, and rides a donkey on wheels, has little cause for pride; but the knight was haughty, and seldom remembered his circumstances. So the donkey suffered sorely, and in many ways.\nOne day the donkey and the knight were on the table in front of the child to whom they both belonged. She was cutting out a little doll's frock with a large pair of scissors.\n\"Mistress,\" said the knight, \"this donkey tries my temper. Will you give me some spurs?\"\n\"Oh, no, sir knight,\" the child answered. \"You would hurt the poor donkey; besides, you have no heels to put them on.\"\n\"Cruel knight!\" exclaimed the donkey. \"Make him get off, dear mistress; I will carry him no longer.\"\n\"Let him stay,\" said the child, gently; \"he has no legs, and cannot walk.\"\n\"Then why did he want spurs?\"\n\"Just the way of the world, dear donkey; just the way of the world.\"\n\"Ah!\" sighed the donkey, \"some ways are very trying, especially the world's;\" and then it said no more, but thought of the fields it would never see, and the thistles it would never taste. />\n Action: kill_app\n\nCurrent Database: {'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Two Travelers in Desert'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'A Pound is a Pound'}, {'category': 'Bedtime Stories', 'title': 'The tale of the foolish gardener'}, {'category': 'Adventure Tales', 'title': 'The Adventures of Sinbad'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'The Power of Silence'}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The action \"kill_app\" simply indicates the user closed the application, and no changes were made to the reading list or any other part of the backend database.

For some reason of her own, she favored me with her friendship, and it became my custom to start so early to Sunday-school that I could spend an hour with her. Her room was very odd to look at ; she had a fancy for putting almost everything into a separate little bag. The hair-brush, coarse and fine combs, were each suspended in a bag just exactly large enough. Even the penholder stuck out of the top of a slender bag that just fitted it. Would you imagine a thimble-bag also? It was a fact. It took me several visits to become accustomed to her oddity. \" It was partly on account of the dust, and partly a habit of order,\" she said. I found out through her kindness of heart that some of these calico bags held a bunch of grapes and an apple each. \"I've got grandchildren,\" she explained.\nShe also had a Bible so very old that the pages were yellow, and it was so large it was awkward to hold.

Her room was very odd to look at ; she had a fancy for putting almost everything into a separate little bag. The hair-brush, coarse and fine combs, were each suspended in a bag just exactly large enough. Even the penholder stuck out of the top of a slender bag that just fitted it. Would you imagine a thimble-bag also? It was a fact. It took me several visits to become accustomed to her oddity. \" It was partly on account of the dust, and partly a habit of order,\" she said. I found out through her kindness of heart that some of these calico bags held a bunch of grapes and an apple each. \"I've got grandchildren,\" she explained.\nShe also had a Bible so very old that the pages were yellow, and it was so large it was awkward to hold. Many a pleasant talk we had, she explaining to me passages that were obscure. How I loved to read the writings of Esdras in the Apocrypha, and how odd were some of the names in the old Bible ! Such old-fashioned ear-rings as she wore, too. One day I asked her if she had not had them a long time, for my mother had, hidden safely away, a pair something like them that grandpa gave her for her fifth birthday, when he came home with his ship.

The young man said that his father has died and could not get out of the sorrow. But he wants to perform the best after-life rituals for his father. So that his father’s soul would go to heaven irrespective of what his father has done in his life, either good or bad.\nSo I came to you with the request, “Please do the afterlife rituals for my father, so that his soul will gain entry to heaven and resides there”.\nBuddha Said, “Okay, bring two earthen pots, some pebbles, and butter to fill ‘the pots”.\nYoung man thinking that these items are for last rituals went to the market and bought them.\nBuddha said, “Fill one pot with pebbles and one pot with Butter and seal them. And then go and drop both the pots at the nearby pond”.\nThe young man did so and both the pots sank to the bottom.\nThen Buddha said, “Now break them open with a stick!”.\nThe young man struck hard and broke the pots, the butter from one pot started floating on the surface and the pebbles from the other pot settled at the bottom.\nThen Buddha Said, “Well I have done this much, Now call all your priests and ask them to pray, so that butter will sink down and pebbles will start floating on the Surface!.\nThe young man in shock asked, “How is it possible?. The pebbles are heavier than water and they will stay only in the bottom whereas butter is lighter than water and it will only float. So, doing the opposite is against the law of nature”.\nBuddha said, “Young man, you understand the law of nature pretty well but you forget that it applies to everyone.”\nIn all his life, if your father performed wrong actions that were heavy like pebbles, he is bound to go down and no one will pick him up.\nIf he had performed right actions that were lighter like butter then he is bound to go up and no one can push him down”.\nYoungman now completely understood the law of nature and fell on Buddha’s feet and thanked him for the teaching on the law of nature.\nMoral of the story:\nThe Law of nature clearly defines us that in life, whatever we do either good or bad, we are going to get It back, that’s the Law of Karma.\nNo external power can change it. While we live, we must perform only good things In our day-to-day life.\nWhat you seed, you will reap.\nThese stories of Buddha must have helped you to understand the way we live our life. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 5: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\n\nThe backend action of the last step:\npass\nThe execution result of the backend action:\n{'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Two Travelers in Desert'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'A Pound is a Pound'}, {'category': 'Bedtime Stories', 'title': 'The tale of the foolish gardener'}, {'category': 'Adventure Tales', 'title': 'The Adventures of Sinbad'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'The Power of Silence'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'An Hour with the Aged'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Mother’s Love for Her Son'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'Law of Karma'}]}\nPlease now give the next state:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nNext State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n"}], "idx": 147}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: English Stories :Short Stories\nApp Description: A collection of English-language short stories for learners, helping users improve their reading skills while enjoying engaging tales.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 1: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Inspiring Stories />\nRound 2: State: <Inspiring Stories /><1.

Law of Karma />\nRound 1: State: <Law of Karma /><Law of Karma /><One day Buddha was doing meditation when a young man visited him and he looked very upset.\nBuddha asked him the reason. The young man said that his father has died and could not get out of the sorrow. But he wants to perform the best after-life rituals for his father. So that his father’s soul would go to heaven irrespective of what his father has done in his life, either good or bad.\nSo I came to you with the request, “Please do the afterlife rituals for my father, so that his soul will gain entry to heaven and resides there”.\nBuddha Said, “Okay, bring two earthen pots, some pebbles, and butter to fill ‘the pots”.\nYoung man thinking that these items are for last rituals went to the market and bought them.\nBuddha said, “Fill one pot with pebbles and one pot with Butter and seal them. And then go and drop both the pots at the nearby pond”.\nThe young man did so and both the pots sank to the bottom.\nThen Buddha said, “Now break them open with a stick!”.\nThe young man struck hard and broke the pots, the butter from one pot started floating on the surface and the pebbles from the other pot settled at the bottom.\nThen Buddha Said, “Well I have done this much, Now call all your priests and ask them to pray, so that butter will sink down and pebbles will start floating on the Surface!.\nThe young man in shock asked, “How is it possible?. The pebbles are heavier than water and they will stay only in the bottom whereas butter is lighter than water and it will only float. So, doing the opposite is against the law of nature”.\nBuddha said, “Young man, you understand the law of nature pretty well but you forget that it applies to everyone.”\nIn all his life, if your father performed wrong actions that were heavy like pebbles, he is bound to go down and no one will pick him up.\nIf he had performed right actions that were lighter like butter then he is bound to go up and no one can push him down”.\nYoungman now completely understood the law of nature and fell on Buddha’s feet and thanked him for the teaching on the law of nature.\nMoral of the story:\nThe Law of nature clearly defines us that in life, whatever we do either good or bad, we are going to get It back, that’s the Law of Karma.\nNo external power can change it. While we live, we must perform only good things In our day-to-day life.\nWhat you seed, you will reap.\nThese stories of Buddha must have helped you to understand the way we live our life. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 2: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 3: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Short Stories />\nRound 4: State: <Short Stories /><1.

One day, a sailor named Billy Bones came to stay in their Inn. He was tall, huge and had a big scar across one of his cheeks, he resembled a pirate. He spoke in a loud and harsh voice and carried a heavy iron chest with him. Young Jim was curious to know what was inside that chest.\nAll day long, Billy kept looking at the ships through the window of the Inn. Every night he would get drunk and start a quarrel with other customers. No one dared talk to him because he was just so mean and nasty and he would beat them if anyone came near his table. Young Jim was impressed with Billy’s strength. Billy told of his adventures at the sea and warned Jim about the one-legged man. Jim and his parents were unhappy because Billy never paid his bills.\nOne evening, a mysterious blind man named Pew came to the Inn and asked for Billy Bones. He gave Billy a piece of paper and on that paper was one black dot right at the center of it. One glance at the paper and Billy was on the floor. He had dropped dead! Jim hurried to see what had happened but it was too late.\nJim and his mother found the treasure chest under Billy’s bed. They opened it and to their surprise, they found bags and bags of gold coins. They decided to use the gold for the bills which Billy had not paid. And they also found a strange roll of paper.\nSuddenly, they heard gunshots outside. Three policemen were standing nearby and had also heard the gunshots. They rushed  there and found two gangs of pirates fighting among themselves. Seeing the policemen, the pirates ran away. Jim immediately understood that the pirates must have come to get Billy’s chest. Jim asked the policemen if he could meet the Squire. The Squire patiently listened to Jim as he told him all about Billy, the chest, the rolled paper and the attack. They decided to open the paper and discovered that it was the map of an island revealing the path to a buried treasure called Flint’s Fist. Quite excited, the Squire decided to go to the island himself and hunt for the treasure. He invited Jim to come with him. The Squire hired a ship named Hispaniola and they sailed to Treasure Island.\nOn the first day of their journey, Jim met a cook, Long John Silver, who had only one leg. No sooner did Jim meet him than he remembered Billy’s warning against the man with one leg. He became very suspicious and stayed away from Long John Silver. But Jim’s fear disappeared once he talked with Long John Silver. He was a nice, jolly man. He took Jim to his kitchen and while cooking dinner, told him funny stories. Jim liked him very much.\nAfter dinner one night, Jim was crawling into the large barrel to get an apple when he fell inside. As he was coming out, he heard footsteps. It was Long John Silver. He and his men were plotting to hijack the ship, get the treasure and murder the Squire and his men. Jim knew he had to tell the Squire immediately. Jim ran and told others about Silver’s plan. The Squire thought long and hard for quite some time and asked them to wait until they reached the island before they did anything. He warned others to be careful of Silver.\nSoon they arrived at the island and everyone got into a row boat to get to shore. Silver had become suspicious of the Squire and as soon as the island became visible, he jumped out of the boat to get ashore first. Once the boat touched the shore, Jim also jumped out and ran into the forest before anyone could stop him. Once Jim was deep in the Island’s forest, he met a strange  beggarly looking man named Ben Gunn. He was another pirate from Flint’s gang who was marooned on the island three years ago.\nJim told him about the treasure. Ben agreed to help Jim. Suddenly, they heard gunshots. They hid behind the bushes and they saw the Squire and Silver fighting with each other. Silver quickly ran into the bushes where he found Jim and the strange man. He asked them to accompany him in the search for the treasure. Jim reluctantly agreed. He had no other choice. As they walked, they came across a skeleton and a big hole in the ground. Everyone thought that they found the treasure and started to dig at once.\nMeanwhile, the Squire came after Silver with his crew. Silver and his men were outnumbered. They were surrounded and Silver surrendered and apologized for his mistakes and he was forgiven. Ben had already found the treasure earlier and had moved it to the safe place. He led them all yo the treasure.\nEarly the next morning, they were all ready to journey back home. It was a memorable adventure which no one would ever forget. Long John Silver was the changed man now. He wanted to help Jim and his mother and look after them in the Inn.

Treasure Island />\nRound 4: State: <Treasure Island /><Treasure Island /><Long ago, there lived a smart young lad named Jim Hawkins whose parents owned the Admiral Benbow Inn beside the sea. One day, a sailor named Billy Bones came to stay in their Inn. He was tall, huge and had a big scar across one of his cheeks, he resembled a pirate. He spoke in a loud and harsh voice and carried a heavy iron chest with him. Young Jim was curious to know what was inside that chest.\nAll day long, Billy kept looking at the ships through the window of the Inn. Every night he would get drunk and start a quarrel with other customers. No one dared talk to him because he was just so mean and nasty and he would beat them if anyone came near his table. Young Jim was impressed with Billy’s strength. Billy told of his adventures at the sea and warned Jim about the one-legged man. Jim and his parents were unhappy because Billy never paid his bills.\nOne evening, a mysterious blind man named Pew came to the Inn and asked for Billy Bones. He gave Billy a piece of paper and on that paper was one black dot right at the center of it. One glance at the paper and Billy was on the floor. He had dropped dead! Jim hurried to see what had happened but it was too late.\nJim and his mother found the treasure chest under Billy’s bed. They opened it and to their surprise, they found bags and bags of gold coins. They decided to use the gold for the bills which Billy had not paid. And they also found a strange roll of paper.\nSuddenly, they heard gunshots outside. Three policemen were standing nearby and had also heard the gunshots. They rushed  there and found two gangs of pirates fighting among themselves. Seeing the policemen, the pirates ran away. Jim immediately understood that the pirates must have come to get Billy’s chest. Jim asked the policemen if he could meet the Squire. The Squire patiently listened to Jim as he told him all about Billy, the chest, the rolled paper and the attack. They decided to open the paper and discovered that it was the map of an island revealing the path to a buried treasure called Flint’s Fist. Quite excited, the Squire decided to go to the island himself and hunt for the treasure. He invited Jim to come with him. The Squire hired a ship named Hispaniola and they sailed to Treasure Island.\nOn the first day of their journey, Jim met a cook, Long John Silver, who had only one leg. No sooner did Jim meet him than he remembered Billy’s warning against the man with one leg. He became very suspicious and stayed away from Long John Silver. But Jim’s fear disappeared once he talked with Long John Silver. He was a nice, jolly man. He took Jim to his kitchen and while cooking dinner, told him funny stories. Jim liked him very much.\nAfter dinner one night, Jim was crawling into the large barrel to get an apple when he fell inside. As he was coming out, he heard footsteps. It was Long John Silver. He and his men were plotting to hijack the ship, get the treasure and murder the Squire and his men. Jim knew he had to tell the Squire immediately. Jim ran and told others about Silver’s plan. The Squire thought long and hard for quite some time and asked them to wait until they reached the island before they did anything. He warned others to be careful of Silver.\nSoon they arrived at the island and everyone got into a row boat to get to shore. Silver had become suspicious of the Squire and as soon as the island became visible, he jumped out of the boat to get ashore first. Once the boat touched the shore, Jim also jumped out and ran into the forest before anyone could stop him. Once Jim was deep in the Island’s forest, he met a strange  beggarly looking man named Ben Gunn. He was another pirate from Flint’s gang who was marooned on the island three years ago.\nJim told him about the treasure. Ben agreed to help Jim. Suddenly, they heard gunshots. They hid behind the bushes and they saw the Squire and Silver fighting with each other. Silver quickly ran into the bushes where he found Jim and the strange man. He asked them to accompany him in the search for the treasure. Jim reluctantly agreed. He had no other choice. As they walked, they came across a skeleton and a big hole in the ground. Everyone thought that they found the treasure and started to dig at once.\nMeanwhile, the Squire came after Silver with his crew. Silver and his men were outnumbered. They were surrounded and Silver surrendered and apologized for his mistakes and he was forgiven. Ben had already found the treasure earlier and had moved it to the safe place. He led them all yo the treasure.\nEarly the next morning, they were all ready to journey back home. It was a memorable adventure which no one would ever forget. Long John Silver was the changed man now. He wanted to help Jim and his mother and look after them in the Inn. Jim had found a new friend. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 5: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\n\nCurrent Database: {'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Two Travelers in Desert'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'A Pound is a Pound'}, {'category': 'Bedtime Stories', 'title': 'The tale of the foolish gardener'}, {'category': 'Adventure Tales', 'title': 'The Adventures of Sinbad'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'The Power of Silence'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'An Hour with the Aged'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Mother’s Love for Her Son'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'Law of Karma'}, {'category': 'Short Stories', 'title': 'An Old Lady in The Cruise'}, {'category': 'Adventure Tales', 'title': 'Treasure Island'}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair indicates that the user is starting the app from the apps list without making any modifications or updates to the reading list.

He noticed that although she was alone, all the staff, ships officers, Waiters and busboys were very familiar with her. So, he asked the waiter who the lady was, expecting to be told…she owned the line, but all the Waiter knew was that she was on the last four cruises, back to back.\nAs he left the dining room one evening he caught her eye and stopped to say hello. They chatted and he asked, \"I understand you've been on this ship for the last four cruises.\"\nShe replied, \"Yes, that's true.\"\nHe said, \"I don't understand\" and she replied, without a pause, \"It's cheaper than a nursing home. So, there will be no nursing home in my future. I'm staying on this cruise; the average cost for a nursing home is $200 per day.

Jim and his parents were unhappy because Billy never paid his bills.\nOne evening, a mysterious blind man named Pew came to the Inn and asked for Billy Bones. He gave Billy a piece of paper and on that paper was one black dot right at the center of it. One glance at the paper and Billy was on the floor. He had dropped dead! Jim hurried to see what had happened but it was too late.\nJim and his mother found the treasure chest under Billy’s bed. They opened it and to their surprise, they found bags and bags of gold coins. They decided to use the gold for the bills which Billy had not paid. And they also found a strange roll of paper.\nSuddenly, they heard gunshots outside. Three policemen were standing nearby and had also heard the gunshots. They rushed  there and found two gangs of pirates fighting among themselves. Seeing the policemen, the pirates ran away. Jim immediately understood that the pirates must have come to get Billy’s chest. Jim asked the policemen if he could meet the Squire. The Squire patiently listened to Jim as he told him all about Billy, the chest, the rolled paper and the attack. They decided to open the paper and discovered that it was the map of an island revealing the path to a buried treasure called Flint’s Fist. Quite excited, the Squire decided to go to the island himself and hunt for the treasure. He invited Jim to come with him. The Squire hired a ship named Hispaniola and they sailed to Treasure Island.\nOn the first day of their journey, Jim met a cook, Long John Silver, who had only one leg. No sooner did Jim meet him than he remembered Billy’s warning against the man with one leg. He became very suspicious and stayed away from Long John Silver. But Jim’s fear disappeared once he talked with Long John Silver. He was a nice, jolly man. He took Jim to his kitchen and while cooking dinner, told him funny stories. Jim liked him very much.\nAfter dinner one night, Jim was crawling into the large barrel to get an apple when he fell inside. As he was coming out, he heard footsteps. It was Long John Silver. He and his men were plotting to hijack the ship, get the treasure and murder the Squire and his men. Jim knew he had to tell the Squire immediately. Jim ran and told others about Silver’s plan. The Squire thought long and hard for quite some time and asked them to wait until they reached the island before they did anything. He warned others to be careful of Silver.\nSoon they arrived at the island and everyone got into a row boat to get to shore. Silver had become suspicious of the Squire and as soon as the island became visible, he jumped out of the boat to get ashore first. Once the boat touched the shore, Jim also jumped out and ran into the forest before anyone could stop him. Once Jim was deep in the Island’s forest, he met a strange  beggarly looking man named Ben Gunn. He was another pirate from Flint’s gang who was marooned on the island three years ago.\nJim told him about the treasure. Ben agreed to help Jim. Suddenly, they heard gunshots. They hid behind the bushes and they saw the Squire and Silver fighting with each other. Silver quickly ran into the bushes where he found Jim and the strange man. He asked them to accompany him in the search for the treasure. Jim reluctantly agreed. He had no other choice. As they walked, they came across a skeleton and a big hole in the ground. Everyone thought that they found the treasure and started to dig at once.\nMeanwhile, the Squire came after Silver with his crew. Silver and his men were outnumbered. They were surrounded and Silver surrendered and apologized for his mistakes and he was forgiven. Ben had already found the treasure earlier and had moved it to the safe place. He led them all yo the treasure.\nEarly the next morning, they were all ready to journey back home. It was a memorable adventure which no one would ever forget. Long John Silver was the changed man now. He wanted to help Jim and his mother and look after them in the Inn. Jim had found a new friend. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 3: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 4: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Animal Stories />\nRound 5: State: <Animal Stories /><1.

He and his men were plotting to hijack the ship, get the treasure and murder the Squire and his men. Jim knew he had to tell the Squire immediately. Jim ran and told others about Silver’s plan. The Squire thought long and hard for quite some time and asked them to wait until they reached the island before they did anything. He warned others to be careful of Silver.\nSoon they arrived at the island and everyone got into a row boat to get to shore. Silver had become suspicious of the Squire and as soon as the island became visible, he jumped out of the boat to get ashore first. Once the boat touched the shore, Jim also jumped out and ran into the forest before anyone could stop him. Once Jim was deep in the Island’s forest, he met a strange  beggarly looking man named Ben Gunn. He was another pirate from Flint’s gang who was marooned on the island three years ago.\nJim told him about the treasure. Ben agreed to help Jim. Suddenly, they heard gunshots. They hid behind the bushes and they saw the Squire and Silver fighting with each other. Silver quickly ran into the bushes where he found Jim and the strange man. He asked them to accompany him in the search for the treasure. Jim reluctantly agreed. He had no other choice. As they walked, they came across a skeleton and a big hole in the ground. Everyone thought that they found the treasure and started to dig at once.\nMeanwhile, the Squire came after Silver with his crew. Silver and his men were outnumbered. They were surrounded and Silver surrendered and apologized for his mistakes and he was forgiven. Ben had already found the treasure earlier and had moved it to the safe place. He led them all yo the treasure.\nEarly the next morning, they were all ready to journey back home. It was a memorable adventure which no one would ever forget. Long John Silver was the changed man now. He wanted to help Jim and his mother and look after them in the Inn. Jim had found a new friend. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 1: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<Animal Stories />\nRound 3: State: <Animal Stories /><1.

One day, a sailor named Billy Bones came to stay in their Inn. He was tall, huge and had a big scar across one of his cheeks, he resembled a pirate. He spoke in a loud and harsh voice and carried a heavy iron chest with him. Young Jim was curious to know what was inside that chest.\nAll day long, Billy kept looking at the ships through the window of the Inn. Every night he would get drunk and start a quarrel with other customers. No one dared talk to him because he was just so mean and nasty and he would beat them if anyone came near his table. Young Jim was impressed with Billy’s strength. Billy told of his adventures at the sea and warned Jim about the one-legged man. Jim and his parents were unhappy because Billy never paid his bills.\nOne evening, a mysterious blind man named Pew came to the Inn and asked for Billy Bones. He gave Billy a piece of paper and on that paper was one black dot right at the center of it. One glance at the paper and Billy was on the floor. He had dropped dead! Jim hurried to see what had happened but it was too late.\nJim and his mother found the treasure chest under Billy’s bed. They opened it and to their surprise, they found bags and bags of gold coins. They decided to use the gold for the bills which Billy had not paid. And they also found a strange roll of paper.\nSuddenly, they heard gunshots outside. Three policemen were standing nearby and had also heard the gunshots. They rushed  there and found two gangs of pirates fighting among themselves. Seeing the policemen, the pirates ran away. Jim immediately understood that the pirates must have come to get Billy’s chest. Jim asked the policemen if he could meet the Squire. The Squire patiently listened to Jim as he told him all about Billy, the chest, the rolled paper and the attack. They decided to open the paper and discovered that it was the map of an island revealing the path to a buried treasure called Flint’s Fist. Quite excited, the Squire decided to go to the island himself and hunt for the treasure. He invited Jim to come with him. The Squire hired a ship named Hispaniola and they sailed to Treasure Island.\nOn the first day of their journey, Jim met a cook, Long John Silver, who had only one leg. No sooner did Jim meet him than he remembered Billy’s warning against the man with one leg. He became very suspicious and stayed away from Long John Silver. But Jim’s fear disappeared once he talked with Long John Silver. He was a nice, jolly man. He took Jim to his kitchen and while cooking dinner, told him funny stories. Jim liked him very much.\nAfter dinner one night, Jim was crawling into the large barrel to get an apple when he fell inside. As he was coming out, he heard footsteps. It was Long John Silver.

The couple offered them food and they slept peacefully.\nThe next morning they heard that the couple's cow had died. The woman was crying and the man looked extremely worried, as the cow was the main breadwinner for the family. They lived on selling their cow's milk.\nThe second angel was very angry, as the first angel had killed the cow. When they argued, the first angel told her, 'I repaired the wall's hollow in the big mansion! The space had a hidden treasure; however, no member in that family was good at heart and they did not deserve it! That is why I closed their treasure. It was not I who killed the cow, but I transferred the death to the cow. Death was approaching the woman and the man who offered their shelter and food to us.\nHowever, don't worry! I have provided them with a pot full of gold coins. They will find that treasure some day and will make good use of it!'\nEverything has two sides. What appears bad may be good and vice versa.\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 1: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <Curious Tales 1500+ /><General Stories /><Adventure Tales /><Moral Stories /><Short Stories /><Animal Stories /><Inspiring Stories /><Classic Stories /><Bedtime Stories />\n Action: touch:<General Stories />\nRound 3: State: <General Stories /><1.

His wife came in and saw that dainty clothes were in readiness, and the husband assumed the expense of the occasion, saying it was little enough he could do, for his own heart had known the loss of his first child only a short time before. The tears of strangers mingled with the mourners, and it may be that the sweet sympathy helped to assuage their grief.\nA young girl came in and looked on, but what was there for her to do ? A sudden thought ! She went out and in a few moments returned with a handful of flowers and laid them upon the casket. The poor mother took one from the rest and laid it in her pocket-book. Brief services were held, and in a few moments the little casket was carried out, the family entered a carriage, and then the few who had gathered around dispersed to their own homes. The little Saint had reached his journey's end, the Zion of his parents hopes, and now endeared to them, by that little mound, their link between earth and heaven.\nIn early times, before the railroad was made, many yielded to the fatigues of travel by wagon. I knew of a young girl whose lover set out for Zion, having not means sufficient for both, but intending to earn money and send back for her. It happened soon after he had gone that means came to her family, and they joyfully set forth with the next company. They had reached \"the plains,\" and one night the young lady, after walking about awhile, sat down to rest. They had seen, day after day, newly-made graves by the way- side. \"Lily, dear, perhaps that is a grave you are sitting upon; there is a board at one end.\" Lily rose and bent over to read the name, then cried out, \" Mother! \" It was the grave of the young man who had left them in England so little while before. This was Lily's first trial in coming to Zion, and the journey from that day must have been a sorrowful one.\nThere was an old man so poor that he was obliged to go into an institution for the poor. The officers granted him the privilege of coming out on Sunday to attend his house of worship, and knew he was a Latter-day Saint too. This was perhaps his only solace, but he kept praying that God would bring him out of that prison life and to Zion. The matter was spoken of in meeting, and word reached Salt Lake City, where an old friend of his had lately come. Very soon it was written to a friend there that the money was forwarded to pay his passage here. On Sunday he was asked after meeting if he could make ready in three days to go to Utah. He was overjoyed, and the release from the house was obtained next day. With his possessions all tied up in one red cotton handkerchief, he left the prison-like walls and went among old acquaintances, bidding them a glad good-by. It so happened that some of these found themselves able to add a few gifts and comforts for the journey, which you may be sure he appreciated. Friends related how he enjoyed the ocean trip and the cities of America, then the cars for the long, swift ride. But, alas ! his feeble frame could not endure the constant excitement and change, and it was thought best to stop over a few days to give him rest. A good elder stayed with him and did all that could be done. One night the old man said, ''Brother, you can go on in the morning with my body. I want it buried in Zion ; but I shall be there in spirit, before you.\" He died happy, because he was free and on his way here.\nChildren who were born in Zion have no idea of the intense, prayerful longing in the hearts of those who desire to gather to God's appointed place. I know all about it, for I once lived out in the world. Can you realize the blessing of emigrating those who cannot otherwise get here ?

So I will return the remaining.\" Saying so,he kept only 4 shells with him and returned the remaining. The boy, very happily kept those shells back in his pocket and went away with his sister...\nA servant in that shop got very surprised watching all these. He asked his master,\" Sir!You gave away such a costly doll just for 4 shells???\n\"The shopkeeper said with a smile,\" Well, For us these are mere shells.\nBut for that boy, these shells are very precious.

A man of solemn countenance, with two little children that clung on either side of him, serious, frightened-looking little things, although they were healthy and neatly dressed. Beside them walked a pale woman with a babe in her arms. Oh, those sad dark eyes ! The group, followed by a few others, moved into the large yard, and when they entered the house, sobs and moans and the cries of little children broke forth. Men and women on the street had noticed and wondered, but no one liked to ask a question, and now well they had gone out of sight. The man who had charge of the house came to show them a room, and render assistance if needed and learned the sad story. The baby had been ailing a little, and just before they reached the city had died in convulsions. The parents must go on in the morning, and the precious one be laid among strangers. The father walked the floor in dumb wretchedness. One after another came in with heart-felt words. One whose heart is ever kind and thoughtful, provided a meal for the travelers and then went out for the little casket. His wife came in and saw that dainty clothes were in readiness, and the husband assumed the expense of the occasion, saying it was little enough he could do, for his own heart had known the loss of his first child only a short time before. The tears of strangers mingled with the mourners, and it may be that the sweet sympathy helped to assuage their grief.\nA young girl came in and looked on, but what was there for her to do ? A sudden thought ! She went out and in a few moments returned with a handful of flowers and laid them upon the casket. The poor mother took one from the rest and laid it in her pocket-book. Brief services were held, and in a few moments the little casket was carried out, the family entered a carriage, and then the few who had gathered around dispersed to their own homes. The little Saint had reached his journey's end, the Zion of his parents hopes, and now endeared to them, by that little mound, their link between earth and heaven.\nIn early times, before the railroad was made, many yielded to the fatigues of travel by wagon. I knew of a young girl whose lover set out for Zion, having not means sufficient for both, but intending to earn money and send back for her. It happened soon after he had gone that means came to her family, and they joyfully set forth with the next company. They had reached \"the plains,\" and one night the young lady, after walking about awhile, sat down to rest. They had seen, day after day, newly-made graves by the way- side. \"Lily, dear, perhaps that is a grave you are sitting upon; there is a board at one end.\" Lily rose and bent over to read the name, then cried out, \" Mother! \" It was the grave of the young man who had left them in England so little while before. This was Lily's first trial in coming to Zion, and the journey from that day must have been a sorrowful one.\nThere was an old man so poor that he was obliged to go into an institution for the poor. The officers granted him the privilege of coming out on Sunday to attend his house of worship, and knew he was a Latter-day Saint too. This was perhaps his only solace, but he kept praying that God would bring him out of that prison life and to Zion. The matter was spoken of in meeting, and word reached Salt Lake City, where an old friend of his had lately come. Very soon it was written to a friend there that the money was forwarded to pay his passage here. On Sunday he was asked after meeting if he could make ready in three days to go to Utah. He was overjoyed, and the release from the house was obtained next day. With his possessions all tied up in one red cotton handkerchief, he left the prison-like walls and went among old acquaintances, bidding them a glad good-by. It so happened that some of these found themselves able to add a few gifts and comforts for the journey, which you may be sure he appreciated. Friends related how he enjoyed the ocean trip and the cities of America, then the cars for the long, swift ride. But, alas ! his feeble frame could not endure the constant excitement and change, and it was thought best to stop over a few days to give him rest. A good elder stayed with him and did all that could be done. One night the old man said, ''Brother, you can go on in the morning with my body. I want it buried in Zion ; but I shall be there in spirit, before you.\" He died happy, because he was free and on his way here.\nChildren who were born in Zion have no idea of the intense, prayerful longing in the hearts of those who desire to gather to God's appointed place.

The only person she didn’t hate was her loving boyfriend, as he was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry him.\nOne day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her – now she could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, “now that you can see the world, will you marry me?”\nThe girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying:\n“Just take care of my eyes dear.”\nMoral: When our circumstances change, so does our mind. Some people may not be able to see the way things were before, and might not be able to appreciate them.

As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them.

As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them. Because of this, most of the plants lost their roots in this process and started drying up.\nThe next day, the landlord came out for a stroll in his favorite garden, and noticed that all his plants had been uprooted, and that they were drying up.

He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them. Because of this, most of the plants lost their roots in this process and started drying up.\nThe next day, the landlord came out for a stroll in his favorite garden, and noticed that all his plants had been uprooted, and that they were drying up. He immediately summoned for the gardener. The frightened gardener told the landlord what had happened, and this made the landlord very angry and he immediately dismissed the gardener from his job.\nAs a result of his foolish act, the gardener lost his job!\n />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 4: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\n\nCurrent Database: {'reading_list': [{'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The little girl and mushrooms'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'The rat that bargained too many'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Two Travelers in Desert'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'A Pound is a Pound'}, {'category': 'Bedtime Stories', 'title': 'The tale of the foolish gardener'}, {'category': 'Adventure Tales', 'title': 'The Adventures of Sinbad'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'The Power of Silence'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'An Hour with the Aged'}, {'category': 'Moral Stories', 'title': 'Mother’s Love for Her Son'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'Law of Karma'}, {'category': 'Short Stories', 'title': 'An Old Lady in The Cruise'}, {'category': 'Adventure Tales', 'title': 'Treasure Island'}, {'category': 'Animal Stories', 'title': 'Friendship'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'What is the cost of doll'}, {'category': 'Classic Stories', 'title': 'Died on the Way'}, {'category': 'Inspiring Stories', 'title': 'The Blind Girl'}, {'category': 'General Stories', 'title': 'Bell The Cat'}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair involves navigating to a different category (\"General Stories\") within the frontend interface.

As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\".
