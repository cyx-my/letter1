When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n"}], "idx": 69}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: HP Smart\nApp Description: The official HP app for printing, scanning, checking printer status, and managing documents from mobile devices.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Navigate up /><https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_4995448-4995651-16?openCLC=true /><More options /><HP printers - Cannot sign in to or create an HP Smart account | HP® Support><Close /><Select your country/region and language /><Americas /><Europe, Middle East, Africa /><Asia Pacific and Oceania /></HP printers - Cannot sign in to or create an HP Smart account | HP® Support>\n Action: start_app\nRound 1: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Access exclusive app features with an HP account />\nRound 2: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\n\nCurrent Database: {}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair indicates that the user started the application and navigated to the HP All-In Plan page.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: scroll_down:<HP All-In Plan />\n\nCurrent Database: {}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair indicates that the user is navigating through the interface by scrolling down to view more options in regard to the HP All-In Plan.

Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Create Account />\n\nCurrent Database: {}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The user has selected the \"Create Account\" option, which indicates the initiation of user account creation.

You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 4: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Create Account />\nRound 5: State: <Getting information… />\n Action: scroll_down:<HP Smart />\n\nCurrent Database: {'users': [{'account_status': 'pending_creation', 'details': {}}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair indicates that the user is scrolling through the HP Smart application interface to view additional content.

And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 3: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Create Account />\nRound 4: State: <Getting information… />\n Action: scroll_down:<HP Smart />\nRound 5: State: <Thanks for waiting… />\n Action: touch:<Something unexpected happened />\n\nThe backend action of the last step:\npass\nThe execution result of the backend action:\n{'users': [{'account_status': 'pending_creation', 'details': {}}]}\nPlease now give the next state:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nNext State: <Something unexpected happened /><We weren’t able to resolve the issue and can’t finish printer setup right now.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 4: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 5: State: <Apps list /><Search />\n Action: start_app\n\nCurrent Database: {'users': [{'account_status': 'active', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'off'}, 'printer_setup': 'new_hp_printer_connected'}}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair doesn't indicate any specific update, change, or addition to be performed on the backend database.

If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan.

You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle.

We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience.

With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter.

And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Never run out & save close />\nRound 3: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 2: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Never run out & save close />\nRound 3: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience.

With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site.

If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 1: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<Never run out & save close />\nRound 2: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site.

For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics.

This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of tools used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. /><\n /><\n /><For more detail on the third parties who use or have access to these tools, please see Privacy Preference Center. /><\n /><\n /><How can you manage these Automatic Data Tools? /><\n /><\n /><Automatic Data Tools that are Strictly Necessary, and third-party technologies used for Performance & Analytics or Personalization are set to expire after the industry standard 2 years. Automatic Data Collection Tools used for targeting are set to expire after 90 days since your last visit. /><\n /><\n /><When you visit HP sites, you have the option to accept or adjust what categories of cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our Privacy Preference Center. You can modify these settings or withdraw your consent at any time by visiting Privacy Preference Center. Your consent is valid for 13 months, after which you will be prompted to update your preferences. /><\n /><\n /><Alternatively, you may also set your browser to block all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set.

Once the browser session is closed, typically all cookies collected during the session are automatically destroyed. /><\n /><\n /><Even if you opt-out of Performance & Analytics tracking and Targeting, you might continue to see non-personalized advertisements from HP via our partners. As an example, you might visit a website containing Personal Computer feature comparisons. Based on your interest, our partners might serve you with HP product advertisements. /><\n /><\n /><In the US and Canada, we comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance industry standards with respect to interest-based advertising.

In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit  /><www.networkadvertising.org />< to learn more. Note that opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. /><\n /><\n /><Some web browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling “Do Not Track” requests, therefore at this time, our websites may not respond to “Do Not Track” requests or headers from these browsers. /><\n /><\n /><HP ADS AND OFFERINGS ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES /><\n /><\n /><HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of tools used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. /><\n /><\n /><For more detail on the third parties who use or have access to these tools, please see Privacy Preference Center. /><\n /><\n /><How can you manage these Automatic Data Tools? /><\n /><\n /><Automatic Data Tools that are Strictly Necessary, and third-party technologies used for Performance & Analytics or Personalization are set to expire after the industry standard 2 years.

This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of tools used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. /><\n /><\n /><For more detail on the third parties who use or have access to these tools, please see Privacy Preference Center. /><\n /><\n /><How can you manage these Automatic Data Tools? /><\n /><\n /><Automatic Data Tools that are Strictly Necessary, and third-party technologies used for Performance & Analytics or Personalization are set to expire after the industry standard 2 years. Automatic Data Collection Tools used for targeting are set to expire after 90 days since your last visit. /><\n /><\n /><When you visit HP sites, you have the option to accept or adjust what categories of cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our Privacy Preference Center. You can modify these settings or withdraw your consent at any time by visiting Privacy Preference Center. Your consent is valid for 13 months, after which you will be prompted to update your preferences. /><\n /><\n /><Alternatively, you may also set your browser to block all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set. For more information, please refer to your browser settings. Note that by disabling certain categories of cookies, you may be prevented from accessing some features of our sites or certain content or functionality may not be available. Certain browsers allow you to navigate websites in an incognito or private mode. Once the browser session is closed, typically all cookies collected during the session are automatically destroyed. /><\n /><\n /><Even if you opt-out of Performance & Analytics tracking and Targeting, you might continue to see non-personalized advertisements from HP via our partners. As an example, you might visit a website containing Personal Computer feature comparisons. Based on your interest, our partners might serve you with HP product advertisements. /><\n /><\n /><In the US and Canada, we comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance industry standards with respect to interest-based advertising. To learn more about your advertising choices if you are in the US, please  /><click here />< or in Canada please  /><click here /><. In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit  /><www.networkadvertising.org />< to learn more. Note that opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. /><\n /><\n /><Some web browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling “Do Not Track” requests, therefore at this time, our websites may not respond to “Do Not Track” requests or headers from these browsers. /><\n /><\n /><HP ADS AND OFFERINGS ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES /><\n /><\n /><HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. Sometimes this will be achieved by sharing data collected through Automated Data Collection Tools. In addition, we use and may allow ad networks and other third parties to use cookies and other Automated Data Collection Tools to determine how you interact with our websites, communications and services and selected partner websites and to identify your interests, create profiles and interest segments in order to provide advertising that is most relevant and useful to you. /><\n /><\n /><SHARING WITH PARTNERS /><\n /><\n /><Based on your consent through our cookie settings, HP may share targeting cookie data with select partners for the purposes of audience selection and advertisement.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience.

With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of tools used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. /><\n /><\n /><For more detail on the third parties who use or have access to these tools, please see Privacy Preference Center. /><\n /><\n /><How can you manage these Automatic Data Tools? /><\n /><\n /><Automatic Data Tools that are Strictly Necessary, and third-party technologies used for Performance & Analytics or Personalization are set to expire after the industry standard 2 years. Automatic Data Collection Tools used for targeting are set to expire after 90 days since your last visit. /><\n /><\n /><When you visit HP sites, you have the option to accept or adjust what categories of cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our Privacy Preference Center. You can modify these settings or withdraw your consent at any time by visiting Privacy Preference Center.

Once the browser session is closed, typically all cookies collected during the session are automatically destroyed. /><\n /><\n /><Even if you opt-out of Performance & Analytics tracking and Targeting, you might continue to see non-personalized advertisements from HP via our partners. As an example, you might visit a website containing Personal Computer feature comparisons. Based on your interest, our partners might serve you with HP product advertisements. /><\n /><\n /><In the US and Canada, we comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance industry standards with respect to interest-based advertising.

In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit  /><www.networkadvertising.org />< to learn more. Note that opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. /><\n /><\n /><Some web browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling “Do Not Track” requests, therefore at this time, our websites may not respond to “Do Not Track” requests or headers from these browsers. /><\n /><\n /><HP ADS AND OFFERINGS ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES /><\n /><\n /><HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. Sometimes this will be achieved by sharing data collected through Automated Data Collection Tools. In addition, we use and may allow ad networks and other third parties to use cookies and other Automated Data Collection Tools to determine how you interact with our websites, communications and services and selected partner websites and to identify your interests, create profiles and interest segments in order to provide advertising that is most relevant and useful to you. /><\n /><\n /><SHARING WITH PARTNERS /><\n /><\n /><Based on your consent through our cookie settings, HP may share targeting cookie data with select partners for the purposes of audience selection and advertisement.

This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter.

We do this to understand your use of our HP Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. /><\n /><\n /><You can find more information about these technologies at:  /><www.allaboutcookies.org /><. /><\n /><\n /><ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS /><\n /><\n /><When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience. /><\n /><\n /><HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons: /><\n /><\n /><Strictly Necessary Tools: />< These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter.

Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site. As an example, if you visited one of our product pages, via the use of cookies, we may retarget you across partner sites with additional offers and promotions for a certain period of time. /><\n /><\n /><Social Media Tools: />< If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. /><\n /><\n /><These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \"like\" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of tools used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. /><\n /><\n /><For more detail on the third parties who use or have access to these tools, please see Privacy Preference Center. /><\n /><\n /><How can you manage these Automatic Data Tools? /><\n /><\n /><Automatic Data Tools that are Strictly Necessary, and third-party technologies used for Performance & Analytics or Personalization are set to expire after the industry standard 2 years. Automatic Data Collection Tools used for targeting are set to expire after 90 days since your last visit. /><\n /><\n /><When you visit HP sites, you have the option to accept or adjust what categories of cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our Privacy Preference Center. You can modify these settings or withdraw your consent at any time by visiting Privacy Preference Center. Your consent is valid for 13 months, after which you will be prompted to update your preferences. /><\n /><\n /><Alternatively, you may also set your browser to block all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set.

Certain browsers allow you to navigate websites in an incognito or private mode. Once the browser session is closed, typically all cookies collected during the session are automatically destroyed. /><\n /><\n /><Even if you opt-out of Performance & Analytics tracking and Targeting, you might continue to see non-personalized advertisements from HP via our partners. As an example, you might visit a website containing Personal Computer feature comparisons. Based on your interest, our partners might serve you with HP product advertisements. /><\n /><\n /><In the US and Canada, we comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance industry standards with respect to interest-based advertising.

In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt out of a number of advertising cookies. Please visit  /><www.networkadvertising.org />< to learn more. Note that opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. /><\n /><\n /><Some web browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling “Do Not Track” requests, therefore at this time, our websites may not respond to “Do Not Track” requests or headers from these browsers. /><\n /><\n /><HP ADS AND OFFERINGS ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES /><\n /><\n /><HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. Sometimes this will be achieved by sharing data collected through Automated Data Collection Tools. In addition, we use and may allow ad networks and other third parties to use cookies and other Automated Data Collection Tools to determine how you interact with our websites, communications and services and selected partner websites and to identify your interests, create profiles and interest segments in order to provide advertising that is most relevant and useful to you. /><\n /><\n /><SHARING WITH PARTNERS /><\n /><\n /><Based on your consent through our cookie settings, HP may share targeting cookie data with select partners for the purposes of audience selection and advertisement.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n"}], "idx": 201}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: HP Smart\nApp Description: The official HP app for printing, scanning, checking printer status, and managing documents from mobile devices.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Use of Cookies and Other Technologies | HP® Ireland><Skip to Content /><Skip to Footer />< />< /><Sign in /><Open Menu /><b5JYDDvafHPFuN+4c+2oOkozrR6nuftws8BSaIjEE8FqgxM7o8QjBXhQ6BOZtleqTbyX0aiaeJ4vgw4agYHbx /><Use of Cookies and Other Technologies /><\n /><We use and allow select partners to use cookies, clickstream capture, pixels, web beacons, web collection forms and other similar technologies (collectively “Automatic Data Collection Tools”) on our HP Services.

It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.

With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\n\nThe backend action of the last step:\npass\nThe execution result of the backend action:\n{'users': [{'account_status': 'active', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'on'}, 'printer_setup': 'adding_new_printer'}}]}\nPlease now give the next state:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nNext State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n"}], "idx": 203}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: HP Smart\nApp Description: The official HP app for printing, scanning, checking printer status, and managing documents from mobile devices.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <Use of Cookies and Other Technologies | HP® Ireland><Skip to Content /><Skip to Footer />< />< /><Sign in />< /><Explore  /><Shop  /><Support  /><Z Logo - Homepage /><Omen Logo - Homepage /><HyperX Logo - Homepage /><Poly Logo - Homepage /><b5JYDDvafHPFuN+4c+2oOkozrR6nuftws8BSaIjEE8FqgxM7o8QjBXhQ6BOZtleqTbyX0aiaeJ4vgw4agYHbx /><Use of Cookies and Other Technologies /><\n /><We use and allow select partners to use cookies, clickstream capture, pixels, web beacons, web collection forms and other similar technologies (collectively “Automatic Data Collection Tools”) on our HP Services.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: touch:<HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 />\n\nCurrent Database: {'users': [{'account_status': 'active', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'on'}, 'printer_setup': 'adding_new_printer'}}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair indicates that the user is interacting with the HP All-In Plan which offers a new printer subscription plan.

For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually.

If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience.

With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime.

You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using. /><\n /><\n /><Performance and Analytics Tools: />< These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites. /><\n /><\n /><We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity. /><\n /><\n /><The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites. /><\n /><\n /><Personalization Tools: />< These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests. /><\n /><\n /><We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer. These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them. /><\n /><\n /><Targeting Tools: />< These are set by HP and other third parties (such as select retail or advertising networks) and used to build a profile to deliver targeted advertising off HP websites and applications that is more relevant and useful to you. These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address). /><\n /><\n /><These also allow us to collect data related to the HP site and page you visited and your activities on the HP site.

It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out.

As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime.

At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 3: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: scroll_up:<Never run out & save />\nRound 4: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 1: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: scroll_up:<Never run out & save />\nRound 2: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 1: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: scroll_up:<Never run out & save />\nRound 2: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost.

You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime.

You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\n\nThe backend action of the last step:\npass\nThe execution result of the backend action:\n{'users': [{'account_status': 'enrolled_in_plan', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'on'}, 'printer_setup': 'HP All-In Plan setup'}}]}\nPlease now give the next state:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nNext State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n"}], "idx": 223}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: HP Smart\nApp Description: The official HP app for printing, scanning, checking printer status, and managing documents from mobile devices.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <HP original ink replacement options | HP?

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: scroll_up:<None />\n\nCurrent Database: {'users': [{'account_status': 'enrolled_in_plan', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'on'}, 'printer_setup': 'HP All-In Plan setup'}}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair represents a user scrolling up in the mobile application interface, which does not involve any action that affects the backend database.

It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges.

The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out.

Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\nRound 5: State: <HP Smart /><Notifications /><Printer Info /><Add Your First Printer /><Do more with HP Smart><Do more with HP Smart /><See All /><HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><HP All-In Plan /><Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support /><Starting at $6.99/month /><HP All-In Plan close /></HP All-In Plan Get a new printer plus ink and 24/7 support Starting at $6.99/month HP All-In Plan close><Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Never run out & save /><Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling /><View Plans /><Never run out & save close /></Never run out & save Up to 50% on ink, delivery, and recycling View Plans Never run out & save close><Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Unlock cloud features /><Access exclusive app features with an HP account /><Create account or sign in /><Unlock cloud features close /></Unlock cloud features Access exclusive app features with an HP account Create account or sign in Unlock cloud features close><Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Try camera scan /><Use your mobile device to easily scan documents /><Learn More /><Try camera scan close /></Try camera scan Use your mobile device to easily scan documents Learn More Try camera scan close><Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close><Shortcuts save time /><Complete repetitive tasks with one touch /><Learn More /><Shortcuts save time close /></Shortcuts save time Complete repetitive tasks with one touch Learn More Shortcuts save time close></Do more with HP Smart><Get Supplies /><Printables /><Sign In /><Create Account /><App Settings />\n Action: scroll_up:<Do more with HP Smart />\n\nCurrent Database: {'users': [{'account_status': 'enrolled_in_plan', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'on'}, 'printer_setup': 'HP All-In Plan setup'}}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair involves scrolling up within the interface of the app but does not indicate any changes that affect the database.

With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set.

You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e /><$120 /><$60 /><HP ENVY Inspire 7258e /><$180 /><$90 /><HP OfficeJet Pro 9010e /><$270 /><$135 /><View all FAQ  /><Disclaimers /><Related links /></HP All-In Plan – Printer Plans | HP® Official Site>\n Action: start_app\n\nCurrent Database: {'users': [{'account_status': 'enrolled_in_plan', 'details': {'notifications': {'supply_status': 'on'}, 'printer_setup': 'HP All-In Plan setup'}, 'sign_in_status': 'signed_in'}]}\nPlease now give the next backend action:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nThought: The current state-action pair indicates that the user has started an app to explore information about the \"HP All-In Plan,\" but there is no indication of any user-specific backend data being updated or modified in the database.

As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e

It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer.

You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime.

You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148.

Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs.

When you sign up, you get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve over the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. All this for one low monthly payment. The best part? It’s risk-free—try for 30 days with no upfront costs and no commitments. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer subscription?   /><Expand /><Yes, the HP All-In Plan is a subscription plan that makes it easy to get a new printer, automatic ink delivery before you ever run out, and continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support. And if you have a printer issue we can't solve on the phone, we’ll send you a replacement, next business day, at no additional cost. Instead of managing multiple bills and services, it’s all consolidated into one easy monthly payment. /><Why get the HP All-In Plan and not just purchase a printer? /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you don’t have to worry about finding the right printer, running out of ink, or troubleshooting printer issues. The HP All-in Plan is an all-inclusive service that ensures you have the printer, ink, and support you need to keep things working, and if they don’t, we’ll send you a new printer the next business day. You can also try it with no upfront costs or commitments, risk-free. If you want a different printer or just don’t feel like the All-In Plan is for you, just give us a call to cancel within the first 30 days and send back the used printer and ink cartridges using the prepaid labels & envelopes. /><What is included in the HP All-In Plan?  /><Expand /><With the HP All-In Plan, you get:  /><• /><A brand new HP printer. /><• /><Automatic ink delivery to your door before you run out. /><• /><Continuous printer coverage with expedited 24/7 Pro live support from our team of experts who know your plan best. /><• /><Next-business-day replacement, at no additional cost. /><• /><The option to upgrade to a new printer after two years or continue with your existing plan. /><How does the HP All-In Plan ensure I don’t run out of ink? /><Expand /><The printer detects when it’s low on ink and automatically sends more right to your door, before you run out. With the HP All-In Plan, you won’t have to make any last-minute trips to the store or remember to buy ink cartridges. /><What if my printing exceeds my monthly allowance? /><Expand /><If you exceed the number of pages in your plan in any given month, and you haven’t accumulated enough rollover pages, you can continue printing without interruption and additional sets of 10–15 pages will be automatically added to your monthly invoice at $1 per set. As long as the printer is connected to the internet, you’ll get an email from us reminding you when you are close to printing all the pages in your plan. You can also easily change your print plan by logging into your HP All-In Plan account and choosing the print plan that’s right for you. /><What happens if I have trouble printing? /><Expand /><24/7 Pro live support is ready to help with any issues you might have with your printer. As long as your HP All-In Plan remains active, your printer is covered. Our HP technicians know the ins and outs of your HP All-In Plan printer and can help troubleshoot and repair issues. For any issue that we can’t resolve over the phone, or online chat, we’ll send you a replacement printer as soon as the next business day, as well as cover any return shipping costs for the printer. /><  /><Connect with 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. You’ll also have access to self-service tools on your My Account page for things like changing plans, viewing your usage, or accessing support materials. Go to  /><MyAccount />< for details on your plan. /><Is the HP All-In Plan a printer rental plan?  /><Expand /><Not exactly. Similar to a printer rental plan, the HP All-In Plan makes it more affordable to get the printer you want at a low monthly price. Plus, with the All-In Plan, all the ink is included and automatically delivered to you at no extra cost. Unlike most rentals where you may pay a deposit and/or you may receive a used product, there are no upfront costs with the HP All-In Plan, and you receive a brand-new printer when you sign up. You also have the flexibility to adjust your plan based on your printing needs. Check out the range of All-In Plan printers  /><HERE />< to learn more.  /><What if I want to cancel my printer plan? /><Expand /><You can cancel anytime. However, if you cancel after the first 30 days but still within the first two years, there is a cancellation fee. You may cancel on your  /><HP account />< webpage, or by contacting 24/7 Pro live support at 1-888-447-0148. /><  /><For cancellations initiated more than 30 days from enrollment date, your HP All-In Plan will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. At the end of your billing cycle, your monthly plan stops, including the ability to print, and you are required to return the printer and ink cartridges to HP within 10 days of your billing cycle ending. HP will supply a prepaid return shipping label to return the printer and ink cartridges. The cancellation fees are listed below. /><  /><  /><Printer /><After 30 days and up to 12 months from enrollment date /><After 12 months and up to 24 months from enrollment date /><HP ENVY 6020e
