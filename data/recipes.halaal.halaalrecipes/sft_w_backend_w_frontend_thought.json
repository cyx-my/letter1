Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><eid-dessert /><ice-creams-fro-yos /><masala-curried-fish /><back-to-school-inspo /><sweets-and-chocolates /><mexican-fiesta /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><eid-dessert /><ice-creams-fro-yos /><masala-curried-fish /><back-to-school-inspo /><sweets-and-chocolates /><mexican-fiesta /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><eid-dessert /><ice-creams-fro-yos /><masala-curried-fish /><back-to-school-inspo /><sweets-and-chocolates /><mexican-fiesta /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><eid-dessert /><ice-creams-fro-yos /><masala-curried-fish /><back-to-school-inspo /><sweets-and-chocolates /><mexican-fiesta /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time.

I cannot give a pin point answer if i was not present with you. Weather affects baking, over beating, microwaving of baking margarine or butter, not using proper baking margarine or proper butter. Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty.

I cannot give a pin point answer if i was not present with you. Weather affects baking, over beating, microwaving of baking margarine or butter, not using proper baking margarine or proper butter. Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

I cannot give a pin point answer if i was not present with you. Weather affects baking, over beating, microwaving of baking margarine or butter, not using proper baking margarine or proper butter. Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

I cannot give a pin point answer if i was not present with you. Weather affects baking, over beating, microwaving of baking margarine or butter, not using proper baking margarine or proper butter. Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty.

Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty.

I cannot give a pin point answer if i was not present with you. Weather affects baking, over beating, microwaving of baking margarine or butter, not using proper baking margarine or proper butter. Not beating the sugar and butter together enough. If the texture of the dough is not correct before it will not bake the way it's supposed to.

But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.

Any suggestions for what do you'll do with the mutton fatty portions and thin kind meat? Like when you get the whole sheep qurbani/aqeeqah time. Because for nice mutton dishes, you mostly use leg Mutton, or the nice chops pieces as they're more meaty. But can't really cook or make use of the other portions /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (1 week ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 4th Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/227/april-2024-4th-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Admin (zaid) Admin (zaid) Master Chef  (2 weeks ago) /><WEEKLY MEAL PLAN\nApril 2024 - 3rd Week\n />< https://halaal.recipes/meal-planners/226/april-2024-3rd-week  /><Like /><  /><(0) /><    /><Reply /><Load More Comments /><Recipe Categories: /><• Appetizer, Sides, Starters Recipes /><• Beef, Mutton, Steak Recipes /><• Biscuits & Pastries Recipes /><• Breakfast, Brunch Recipes /><• Cakes Recipes /><• Chicken Recipes /><• Desserts, Sweet Meats Recipes /><• Indian Sweet Starters Recipes /><• Miscellaneous Recipes /><• Mocktails, Drinks, Juices Recipes /><• Pastas, Pizzas Recipes /><• Rice Dishes Recipes /><• Salads, Healthy, Light Meals Recipes /><• Sandwiches & Breads Recipes /><• Savouries, Sauces, Ramadhaan, Eid Recipes /><• Seafood Recipes /><• Snacks, Sweets Recipes /><• Soups Recipes /><• Vegetarian Recipes /><\n /><Articles & Tutorials: /><cooking-tips /><sealing-a-plastic-bag-the-smart-and-easy-way /><braised-vagaar-rice-step-by-step /><how-to-fold-a-samoosa /><tips-on-baking-cakes /><Browse More /><Popular Collections /><meringues /><potato-side-dish /><mexican-fiesta /><comfort-food /><doughnuts /><10-alloo-paratha /><Browse Collections /><Stay connected with us /><Culinary ideas & inspiration to your inbox. /><Social Media /><halaal recipes Instagram page /><     /><halaal recipes Pinterest page /><     /><halaal recipes facebook page /><     /><halaal recipes Twitter page /><     /><halaal recipes Youtube page /><    /><halaal recipes RSS Feed /><Whatsapp Broadcast List /><Join List><Join List /></Join List><Newsletter SignUp /><Sign up for our email newsletter and we will drop you occasional emails with culinary inspiration. /><Submit /><Recipe Links /><• Popular Collections /><• Highest Rated /><• Top Chicken /><• Top Meaty /><• Crowd Favourites /><• Comment Makers /><Legal Links /><• T & C's /><• Disclaimer /><• Privacy Policy /><• About Us /><© Halaal.Recipes.
