This makes my battery run down a lot and so I need to charge my phone often🔋🔌.\nBecause of this, I have to charge my phone many times and usually in different positions in and out of home📱.\nLet's go👇\nThe most common position I charge my phone is like this🔌, usually in the dining room because that's where I read and there's an available extension box. My sister👩 also charges her phone here too. We both use infinix chargers and smartphones (Infinix Hot 8 and Infinix Hot 6) /><Comment /><75 /><104 /><37 /><30 />\n Action: touch:<2023-03-11 />\nRound 1: State: <8 /><Following /><197 /><Fans /><121 /><Likes /><Jo_ekwo /><⭐ /><Live life as it comes❤️ Infinix for life❤️  /><Chat /><Follow /><Timeline><Timeline /></Timeline><Comment><Comment /></Comment><Profile><Profile /></Profile><Jo_ekwo /><⭐ /><2024-03-01 repost a content /><Repost thread from @MalomoKing /><MalomoKing /><STANLEY NWABALI: MY FAVORITE AFRICAN FOOTBALLER🧤⚽ /><Stanley Nwabali, a Nigerian goalkeeper who plays for Chippa United and the Nigeria national team is my favorite African footb ... /><All />\n Action: touch:<Follow />\nRound 2: State: <Log in to XClub with Infinix ID /><Explore cool stuff around you.😎 /><LOGIN/REGISTER /><Continue with Others /><Facebook /><Username /><By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service and acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy to learn how we collect, use, and share your data. />\n Action: kill_app\nRound 3: State: <Apps list /><Search /><Wi‑Fi />\n Action: start_app\nRound 4: State: <New Version 5.1.5.0.3 /><1.
