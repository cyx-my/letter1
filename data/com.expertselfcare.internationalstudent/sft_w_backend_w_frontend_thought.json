Not surprisingly, they can cause considerable stress and anxiety. So if you feel nervous about assessments and exams, here are some tips for tackling them - and doing well. /><Important: If you fear exams, it can help to know exactly what's expected of you (and what isn’t) and how best to prepare. /><Here are tips for easing your nerves and helping you achieve your best possible grades: /><•  /><Marking:  /><Know what the markings and grades mean to get a realistic picture of what's expected and how you're doing. /><•  /><Revision:  /><Consider revising in various locations, so you won't find being in a new setting for the exam too unsettling. /><•  /><Plan:  /><Decide early on what you're going to revise, and how you're going to do it. /><•  /><Technique:  /><Consider various revision methods, such as revision cards, mind maps, and doing past papers. Try different strategies and use what works best for you. /><•  /><Noise:  /><Spend time revising in situations with background noise, like the campus restaurant. This will train your brain to function despite distractions. /><•  /><Sleep:  /><Ensure you sleep enough before the exam and avoid last-minute revision late at night. /><•  /><Food:  /><Eat healthily and avoid junk food. A balanced diet, including fresh fruit and vegetables, will help to give you focus and energy. /><•  /><Focus:  /><Avoid getting negatively distracted by what other people are doing and saying before the exam. /><•  /><Relaxation:  /><If you feel anxious before or during exams, try relaxation techniques (see the 'Support' section - accessible from the homepage - for more info). /><•  /><Physical activity:  /><Include physical activity in your daily and weekly routines. It's a good de-stressor and will help to make your revision more effective. /><•  /><Staying positive:  /><Don’t let bad days (we all have them) affect you. Don't let exams stress you too much! /><Important: If you're struggling with assessments or exams and feel overwhelmed, overly stressed or physically unwell, speak with your lecturer, tutor, student support team, or doctor (GP). Also, let them know if there's anything else going on in your life that may affect your performance or ability to take part (such as family problems or financial difficulties). They will do what they can to help and won't judge you. /><Learn more about how to do well in your assessments and exams: /><•  /><Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).  /><Study skills guides.  /><www.ucas.com /><•  /><UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA).  /><Study and assessment methods.  /><www.ukcisa.org.uk /><•  /><Prepare for Success.  /><Learning activities to prepare you for study in the UK.  /><www.prepareforsuccess.org.uk /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Exam stress.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Thompson D.  /><Resourcefulness at university.

Here are tips and suggestions for deciding what to take, plus links to more information if you need more detail. /><Consider only packing the things you need for your first few weeks. /><If you travel to the UK by air, don’t forget that most airlines have weight restrictions for check-in luggage and cabin bags unless you pay extra. /><Here's a video by Karen Acosta, a student at the University of Lincoln, with tips on what to pack: /><\n /><YouTube></YouTube><\n /><Important: Remember there are limits to what you can take into the UK, including alcohol, cigarettes and gifts. To stay on the right side of the law and avoid getting into trouble, never bring fake goods, illegal drugs, offensive weapons or indecent materials into the UK. /><The video below on UK Customs Information has further details. /><\n /><\n /><Here's a quick checklist of items to take for your journey and arrival: /><•  /><Passport:  /><Make sure it's valid and that you have a visa if required. /><•  /><Ticket:  /><Ensure you have your plane, train or ferry tickets to hand. /><•  /><Money:  /><Consider ordering British currency or travellers' cheques in advance and have these on you when you travel. Take enough money (about £250) for travel, food, essentials and emergency expenses. Also, make sure you have enough cash immediately available to cover a deposit for your accommodation (if needed), which you may have to pay before you move in (usually about one month's rent, but it can be more). /><•  /><Contact details:  /><Have essential contact details (accommodation, International Student Office, University Security) readily accessible. /><•  /><Medicines:  /><If you take regular medicines, take at least a two-month supply (ideally more) to tie you over until you've registered with a local doctor (GP). Also, bring a note from your doctor explaining what medicines you take, what they're for, and how long you should take them (translated into English). /><•  /><Items for your room:  /><Consider taking small things to you feel at home in your new accommodation, such as photos of family and friends and items of personal value. /><•  /><Adaptors:  /><Consider buying adaptors for your electronic gadgets (such as a phone charger) before you enter the UK or on arrival because the power sockets in the UK will likely differ from those at home. /><Avoid bringing the following: /><•  /><Huge suitcase:  /><Airlines will only allow you to check-in between 20 to 30 kg if you have an economy class ticket, though you can pay for excess baggage. Remember that a large-size suitcase may be challenging to handle on public transport or if you move into accommodation without an elevator. You may also find it difficult to store large suitcases in your room. /><•  /><Winter clothing:  /><Winter clothes can be bulky and heavy and take up a lot of space in your suitcase. You may prefer to buy them in the UK after your arrival. Local department stores or second-hand shops offer winter clothing to suit most budgets. Bring various layers of clothes to keep you warm on and after arrival. /><•  /><Textbooks:  /><You'll unlikely need to read - or buy - every book on your reading list before you arrive. Many titles will be available at your library, or you can buy them second-hand, saving you money too. /><•  /><Homeware:  /><Consider buying cooking utensils, cutlery, bedding and clothes hangers after you arrive. You can get them in department stores, local shops, second-hand from other students, or even for free through apps such as  /><Olio /><or  /><Gumtree /><. /><To learn more about what you can bring into the UK visit: /><•  /><UK Government website.  /><Border Force.  /><www.gov.uk /><•  /><UK Government website.  /><Bringing goods into the UK for personal use.  /><www.gov.uk /><•  /><UK Government website.  /><Entering the UK.  /><www.gov.uk /><\n /><Content last updated: March 2023 /><Next scheduled review to be completed by: March 2026 /><Feedback: To help us improve the app for the benefit of other international students, please send us your comments and suggestions. /><Find contact details and a link to a short anonymous survey on the  /><Feedback page /><. /><Thank you for your help. /><Responsive image /><   /></Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template>\n"}], "idx": 39}, {"conversations": [{"from": "user", "value": "\nYou are going to predict next backend action over the current database given the previous state-action history.\nYou should follow the following format to give your answer:\nThought: (Your reasoning about the given information, and how to predict the backend action)\nBackend Action: (your predicted next backend action)\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nApp Name: International Student App (UK)\nApp Description: Designed to help international students in the UK manage their studies and life, offering visa info, events, and campus resources.\n\nState-Action History:\nRound 0: State: <International Student /><TODO /><TODO /><London area /><Support for students /><FIND SUPPORT /><GET READY /><Prepare your move /><SUPPORT /><Get help and keep well /><Home /><Favourites /><About /><Feedback />\n Action: touch:<Favourites />\nRound 1: State: <Favourites /><No Favourites /><Home /><Favourites /><About /><Feedback />\n Action: touch:<4 />\nRound 2: State: <About /><About this app /><Accessibility /><Team /><Partners /><Disclaimer /><Terms and conditions /><Sources and references /><Contact and support /><Home /><Favourites /><About /><Feedback />\n Action: touch:<9 />\nRound 3: State: <International Student /><TODO /><TODO /><London area /><Support for students /><FIND SUPPORT /><GET READY /><Prepare your move /><SUPPORT /><Get help and keep well /><Home /><Favourites /><About /><Feedback />\n Action: touch:<GET READY />\nRound 4: State: <Navigate up /><GET READY /><Coronavirus guidance at uni /><Preparing for your new life /><Your university experience /><Pre-enrolment-courses /><Getting to know your university /><Visa and immigration issues /><Learning basic life skills /><Health, disability and support /><Key documents /><Cost of maintenance /><What to pack />\n Action: touch:<What to pack />\nRound 5: State: <Navigate up /><What to pack /><Favourite /><Back /><Forward /><Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template><   /><What to pack /><Student sitting on floor while packing /><\n /><When you're getting ready to move to the UK, it can be hard to know what to pack.

Remember that you may be required to present your biometric residence permit (BRP) when you access NHS services. Guidance may be subject to change, so always check government and NHS websites for details and updates (find useful links below). /><Here's a list of some of the services the NHS offers: /><•  /><Online information and advice:  /><The NHS Websites (links below) provide reliable health information and advice on hundreds of medical symptoms and conditions. /><•  /><Doctor's (GP) surgery:  /><Your first point of contact for most health issues and medical treatment. Your doctor, called a general practitioner (or GP), can refer you to the hospital if needed. Your GP surgery will provide several services, including contraception and sexual health. /><•  /><Dentist:  /><Get your teeth checked at least once a year. Not all dentists offer NHS services, and even if you receive treatment on the NHS, you may still need to contribute to the costs. /><•  /><Eye care:  /><High street opticians provide routine eye care services. Eye tests incur a charge, and prices for frames and lenses vary. /><•  /><Hospital:  /><If your GP refers you to the hospital, you may see a specialist doctor.

So here we explain why speaking with someone is essential when you feel overly stressed or overwhelmed. /><Every student experiences normal ups and downs. /><But when, for example, life feels tough because you feel homesick or lonely, lag with your studies or worry about money, speaking with someone - a friend, family member, tutor, student support team member or health professional - can make a big difference. /><Important: Your university support services are there for you. They understand how you feel, care about you, and will want to do their best to help. Speaking with someone if you find life challenging and asking for support is not a sign of weakness. There's no shame in seeking support, even if it embarrasses you or doesn’t align with your culture. Be reassured - you won't be judged and won't waste people's time. Also, accessing university support is free. /><Unfortunately, it can sometimes take a while to find and get the help you need. If that's the case, keep speaking with people and try different things until you get the right support. Don't suffer in silence! /><Here's why seeking help and speaking with someone is so important when you're struggling: /><•  /><Feel relieved.  /><Talking about your problem can make you feel better and help you stop worrying. /><•  /><Understand the problem.  /><Exploring the reasons behind your difficulties can help you determine what may be happening. /><•  /><Find solutions.  /><Discover and discuss possible solutions you may not have thought of otherwise. /><•  /><Get back on track.  /><Return to your normal life faster to re-focus on the things that matter. /><•  /><Prevent future problems.  /><Build up new skills to help you manage other challenging situations in the future. /><Learn more about how to stay well at university and get support when you need it: /><•  /><British Council.  /><Support and guidance.  /><www.study-uk.britishcouncil.org /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Support for me.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Thompson D.  /><Resourcefulness at university.

You may need to pay a healthcare surcharge (called the ‘immigration health surcharge’ or IHS) as part of your immigration application. Remember that you may be required to present your biometric residence permit (BRP) when you access NHS services. Guidance may be subject to change, so always check government and NHS websites for details and updates (find useful links below). /><Here's a list of some of the services the NHS offers: /><•  /><Online information and advice:  /><The NHS Websites (links below) provide reliable health information and advice on hundreds of medical symptoms and conditions. /><•  /><Doctor's (GP) surgery:  /><Your first point of contact for most health issues and medical treatment. Your doctor, called a general practitioner (or GP), can refer you to the hospital if needed. Your GP surgery will provide several services, including contraception and sexual health. /><•  /><Dentist:  /><Get your teeth checked at least once a year. Not all dentists offer NHS services, and even if you receive treatment on the NHS, you may still need to contribute to the costs. /><•  /><Eye care:  /><High street opticians provide routine eye care services. Eye tests incur a charge, and prices for frames and lenses vary. /><•  /><Hospital:  /><If your GP refers you to the hospital, you may see a specialist doctor. Senior specialist doctors are called 'consultants'. /><•  /><Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments:  /><Larger hospitals will have A&E departments, usually open 24 hours a day. You will  /><not />< have to pay for emergency treatment. /><•  /><Emergency services:  /><In an emergency (and  /><only />< then), you can call the free emergency number 999 for an ambulance, the police or the fire service. /><Learn more about how the NHS works and how to access health services: /><•  /><NHS website (England).  /><NHS Services.  /><www.nhs.uk /><•  /><NHS 111 Wales.  /><Sympton checker and local services for Wales. /><111.wales.nhs.uk /><•  /><NHS 24 (Scotland).  /><Health information for Scotland.  /><www.nhs24.scot /><•  /><Health and Social Care Online (Northern Ireland).  /><www.online.hscni.net /><•  /><UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA).  /><How the UK medical system works.  /><www.ukcisa.org.uk /><•  /><UK Government Website (Gov.uk).  /><Pay for UK healthcare as part of your immigration application.  /><www.gov.uk /><\n /><Content last updated: March 2023 /><Next scheduled review to be completed by: March 2026 /><Feedback: To help us improve the app for the benefit of other international students, please send us your comments and suggestions. /><Find contact details and a link to a short anonymous survey on the  /><Feedback page /><. /><Thank you for your help. /><Responsive image /><   /></Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template>\n Action: touch:<Navigate up />\nRound 3: State: <Navigate up /><SUPPORT /><Your wellbeing /><Asking for help /><Student support services /><Mental health support /><Emergencies /><Accessing medical help /><The UK National Health Service (NHS) /><Registering with a doctor (GP) /><Peer support /><Disability support /><Faith and spirituality />\n Action: touch:<Academic culture />\nRound 4: State: <Navigate up /><Asking for help /><Favourite /><Back /><Forward /><Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template><   /><Asking for help /><Man in a white shirt and tie showing a student the way inside a university corridor /><\n /><Student life can be challenging, and there may be times when you need help and support.

They understand how you feel, care about you, and will want to do their best to help. Speaking with someone if you find life challenging and asking for support is not a sign of weakness. There's no shame in seeking support, even if it embarrasses you or doesn’t align with your culture. Be reassured - you won't be judged and won't waste people's time. Also, accessing university support is free. /><Unfortunately, it can sometimes take a while to find and get the help you need. If that's the case, keep speaking with people and try different things until you get the right support. Don't suffer in silence! /><Here's why seeking help and speaking with someone is so important when you're struggling: /><•  /><Feel relieved.  /><Talking about your problem can make you feel better and help you stop worrying. /><•  /><Understand the problem.  /><Exploring the reasons behind your difficulties can help you determine what may be happening. /><•  /><Find solutions.  /><Discover and discuss possible solutions you may not have thought of otherwise. /><•  /><Get back on track.  /><Return to your normal life faster to re-focus on the things that matter. /><•  /><Prevent future problems.  /><Build up new skills to help you manage other challenging situations in the future. /><Learn more about how to stay well at university and get support when you need it: /><•  /><British Council.  /><Support and guidance.  /><www.study-uk.britishcouncil.org /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Support for me.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Thompson D.  /><Resourcefulness at university.

Your doctor, called a general practitioner (or GP), can refer you to the hospital if needed. Your GP surgery will provide several services, including contraception and sexual health. /><•  /><Dentist:  /><Get your teeth checked at least once a year. Not all dentists offer NHS services, and even if you receive treatment on the NHS, you may still need to contribute to the costs. /><•  /><Eye care:  /><High street opticians provide routine eye care services. Eye tests incur a charge, and prices for frames and lenses vary. /><•  /><Hospital:  /><If your GP refers you to the hospital, you may see a specialist doctor. Senior specialist doctors are called 'consultants'. /><•  /><Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments:  /><Larger hospitals will have A&E departments, usually open 24 hours a day. You will  /><not />< have to pay for emergency treatment. /><•  /><Emergency services:  /><In an emergency (and  /><only />< then), you can call the free emergency number 999 for an ambulance, the police or the fire service. /><Learn more about how the NHS works and how to access health services: /><•  /><NHS website (England).  /><NHS Services.  /><www.nhs.uk /><•  /><NHS 111 Wales.  /><Sympton checker and local services for Wales. /><111.wales.nhs.uk /><•  /><NHS 24 (Scotland).  /><Health information for Scotland.  /><www.nhs24.scot /><•  /><Health and Social Care Online (Northern Ireland).  /><www.online.hscni.net /><•  /><UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA).  /><How the UK medical system works.  /><www.ukcisa.org.uk /><•  /><UK Government Website (Gov.uk).  /><Pay for UK healthcare as part of your immigration application.  /><www.gov.uk /><\n /><Content last updated: March 2023 /><Next scheduled review to be completed by: March 2026 /><Feedback: To help us improve the app for the benefit of other international students, please send us your comments and suggestions. /><Find contact details and a link to a short anonymous survey on the  /><Feedback page /><. /><Thank you for your help. /><Responsive image /><   /></Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template>\n Action: touch:<Navigate up />\nRound 1: State: <Navigate up /><SUPPORT /><Your wellbeing /><Asking for help /><Student support services /><Mental health support /><Emergencies /><Accessing medical help /><The UK National Health Service (NHS) /><Registering with a doctor (GP) /><Peer support /><Disability support /><Faith and spirituality />\n Action: touch:<Academic culture />\nRound 2: State: <Navigate up /><Asking for help /><Favourite /><Back /><Forward /><Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template><   /><Asking for help /><Man in a white shirt and tie showing a student the way inside a university corridor /><\n /><Student life can be challenging, and there may be times when you need help and support.

So here we explain why speaking with someone is essential when you feel overly stressed or overwhelmed. /><Every student experiences normal ups and downs. /><But when, for example, life feels tough because you feel homesick or lonely, lag with your studies or worry about money, speaking with someone - a friend, family member, tutor, student support team member or health professional - can make a big difference. /><Important: Your university support services are there for you. They understand how you feel, care about you, and will want to do their best to help. Speaking with someone if you find life challenging and asking for support is not a sign of weakness. There's no shame in seeking support, even if it embarrasses you or doesn’t align with your culture. Be reassured - you won't be judged and won't waste people's time. Also, accessing university support is free. /><Unfortunately, it can sometimes take a while to find and get the help you need. If that's the case, keep speaking with people and try different things until you get the right support. Don't suffer in silence! /><Here's why seeking help and speaking with someone is so important when you're struggling: /><•  /><Feel relieved.  /><Talking about your problem can make you feel better and help you stop worrying. /><•  /><Understand the problem.  /><Exploring the reasons behind your difficulties can help you determine what may be happening. /><•  /><Find solutions.  /><Discover and discuss possible solutions you may not have thought of otherwise. /><•  /><Get back on track.  /><Return to your normal life faster to re-focus on the things that matter. /><•  /><Prevent future problems.  /><Build up new skills to help you manage other challenging situations in the future. /><Learn more about how to stay well at university and get support when you need it: /><•  /><British Council.  /><Support and guidance.  /><www.study-uk.britishcouncil.org /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Support for me.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Thompson D.  /><Resourcefulness at university.

So here we explain why speaking with someone is essential when you feel overly stressed or overwhelmed. /><Every student experiences normal ups and downs. /><But when, for example, life feels tough because you feel homesick or lonely, lag with your studies or worry about money, speaking with someone - a friend, family member, tutor, student support team member or health professional - can make a big difference. /><Important: Your university support services are there for you. They understand how you feel, care about you, and will want to do their best to help. Speaking with someone if you find life challenging and asking for support is not a sign of weakness. There's no shame in seeking support, even if it embarrasses you or doesn’t align with your culture. Be reassured - you won't be judged and won't waste people's time. Also, accessing university support is free. /><Unfortunately, it can sometimes take a while to find and get the help you need. If that's the case, keep speaking with people and try different things until you get the right support. Don't suffer in silence! /><Here's why seeking help and speaking with someone is so important when you're struggling: /><•  /><Feel relieved.  /><Talking about your problem can make you feel better and help you stop worrying. /><•  /><Understand the problem.  /><Exploring the reasons behind your difficulties can help you determine what may be happening. /><•  /><Find solutions.  /><Discover and discuss possible solutions you may not have thought of otherwise. /><•  /><Get back on track.  /><Return to your normal life faster to re-focus on the things that matter. /><•  /><Prevent future problems.  /><Build up new skills to help you manage other challenging situations in the future. /><Learn more about how to stay well at university and get support when you need it: /><•  /><British Council.  /><Support and guidance.  /><www.study-uk.britishcouncil.org /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Support for me.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Thompson D.  /><Resourcefulness at university.

health issue, you might benefit from 'peer support'. Peer support is about getting help from fellow students who have been in a similar situation or share the same experience. Here we explain how peer support works and how to access it. /><Peer support can be helpful because the people you speak with understand what you might be feeling and going through. /><Peer support can take different forms, from mentoring to peer-assisted study sessions and buddy schemes. /><To find out if a peer support scheme is available at your college or university, look online on your university's website, and contact your student support team or Students' Union. /><Tip: Local international student centres may be available at your place of study, offering a place to meet other international students, social events and peer support. /><You can benefit from peer support in various ways: /><•  /><Support:  /><Feel supported, build new relationships and find your identity in a safe and caring environment. /><•  /><Understanding:  /><Discuss and share emotional stresses, and feel understood. /><•  /><Control:  /><Overcome stigma, get back control over your life and become more confident by tackling false ideas, such as that you're 'not good enough' or 'don't deserve help'. /><•  /><Feelings and thoughts:  /><Tackle negative and unhelpful emotions and thoughts. Learn to see your situation in a different light, so that you no longer feel so bad about it. /><•  /><Hope:  /><Stay motivated while you're getting better, be inspired by others and feel more hopeful. /><Tip: Consider providing peer support yourself if you feel able to do so.

So here we give tips for finding faith and spiritual support inside and outside your university or college. /><Important: Most universities have multi-faith chaplaincies and student faith organisations that provide information and spiritual support. They often offer opportunities to drop in and talk, and they oversee the universities' religious activities. Also, consider connecting with local faith communities outside the university.

Peer support is about getting help from fellow students who have been in a similar situation or share the same experience.

Here we explain how peer support works and how to access it. /><Peer support can be helpful because the people you speak with understand what you might be feeling and going through. /><Peer support can take different forms, from mentoring to peer-assisted study sessions and buddy schemes. /><To find out if a peer support scheme is available at your college or university, look online on your university's website, and contact your student support team or Students' Union. /><Tip: Local international student centres may be available at your place of study, offering a place to meet other international students, social events and peer support. /><You can benefit from peer support in various ways: /><•  /><Support:  /><Feel supported, build new relationships and find your identity in a safe and caring environment. /><•  /><Understanding:  /><Discuss and share emotional stresses, and feel understood. /><•  /><Control:  /><Overcome stigma, get back control over your life and become more confident by tackling false ideas, such as that you're 'not good enough' or 'don't deserve help'. /><•  /><Feelings and thoughts:  /><Tackle negative and unhelpful emotions and thoughts. Learn to see your situation in a different light, so that you no longer feel so bad about it. /><•  /><Hope:  /><Stay motivated while you're getting better, be inspired by others and feel more hopeful. /><Tip: Consider providing peer support yourself if you feel able to do so.

So here we give tips for finding faith and spiritual support inside and outside your university or college. /><Important: Most universities have multi-faith chaplaincies and student faith organisations that provide information and spiritual support.

It may give you a confidence boost and turn past negative experiences into something positive. /><Learn more about peer support: /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Peer support for student mental health.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Looking after a mate.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Time to change.  /><Ask twice.  /><www.time-to-change /><\n /><Content last updated: March 2023 /><Next scheduled review to be completed by: March 2026 /><Feedback: To help us improve the app for the benefit of other international students, please send us your comments and suggestions. /><Find contact details and a link to a short anonymous survey on the  /><Feedback page /><. /><Thank you for your help. /><Responsive image /><   /></Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template>\n Action: touch:<Navigate up />\nRound 5: State: <Navigate up /><SUPPORT /><Your wellbeing /><Asking for help /><Student support services /><Mental health support /><Emergencies /><Accessing medical help /><The UK National Health Service (NHS) /><Registering with a doctor (GP) /><Peer support /><Disability support /><Faith and spirituality />\n Action: touch:<Visa and immigration issues />\n\nThe backend action of the last step:\npass\nThe execution result of the backend action:\n{'user_location': {'location': 'London area', 'completion_status': {'section': 'London area', 'status': 'COMPLETED'}}, 'favourites': [{'name': 'Mind.'}]}\nPlease now give the next state:\n"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "\nNext State: <Navigate up /><Accessing medical help /><Favourite /><Back /><Forward /><Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template><   /><Accessing medical help /><Female doctor wearing a headscarf explaining something to a student patient /><\n /><If you need medical assistance, various services are available under the  /><UK National Health Service (NHS) /><.

Here we explain how peer support works and how to access it. /><Peer support can be helpful because the people you speak with understand what you might be feeling and going through. /><Peer support can take different forms, from mentoring to peer-assisted study sessions and buddy schemes. /><To find out if a peer support scheme is available at your college or university, look online on your university's website, and contact your student support team or Students' Union. /><Tip: Local international student centres may be available at your place of study, offering a place to meet other international students, social events and peer support. /><You can benefit from peer support in various ways: /><•  /><Support:  /><Feel supported, build new relationships and find your identity in a safe and caring environment. /><•  /><Understanding:  /><Discuss and share emotional stresses, and feel understood. /><•  /><Control:  /><Overcome stigma, get back control over your life and become more confident by tackling false ideas, such as that you're 'not good enough' or 'don't deserve help'. /><•  /><Feelings and thoughts:  /><Tackle negative and unhelpful emotions and thoughts. Learn to see your situation in a different light, so that you no longer feel so bad about it. /><•  /><Hope:  /><Stay motivated while you're getting better, be inspired by others and feel more hopeful. /><Tip: Consider providing peer support yourself if you feel able to do so. It may give you a confidence boost and turn past negative experiences into something positive. /><Learn more about peer support: /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Peer support for student mental health.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Student Minds.  /><Looking after a mate.  /><www.studentminds.org.uk /><•  /><Time to change.  /><Ask twice.  /><www.time-to-change /><\n /><Content last updated: March 2023 /><Next scheduled review to be completed by: March 2026 /><Feedback: To help us improve the app for the benefit of other international students, please send us your comments and suggestions. /><Find contact details and a link to a short anonymous survey on the  /><Feedback page /><. /><Thank you for your help. /><Responsive image /><   /></Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template>\n Action: touch:<Navigate up />\nRound 1: State: <Navigate up /><SUPPORT /><Your wellbeing /><Asking for help /><Student support services /><Mental health support /><Emergencies /><Accessing medical help /><The UK National Health Service (NHS) /><Registering with a doctor (GP) /><Peer support /><Disability support /><Faith and spirituality />\n Action: touch:<Visa and immigration issues />\nRound 2: State: <Navigate up /><Accessing medical help /><Favourite /><Back /><Forward /><Expert Self Care - Student Health - Template><   /><Accessing medical help /><Female doctor wearing a headscarf explaining something to a student patient /><\n /><If you need medical assistance, various services are available under the  /><UK National Health Service (NHS) /><.
