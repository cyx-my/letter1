However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

Additionally, you might need to change your visa if it's close to expiration. /><Q: How long does the visa change process take? /><A: The duration of the visa change process varies depending on the circumstances, but finding the right documents and sponsor quickly is crucial to expedite the process. /><Q: How can Kowork help? /><A: Kowork services can assist with job searches, sponsor matching for visa changes, interview tips, and documentation support to help facilitate a smooth visa change process. /><Q: What documents are required for a visa change? /><A: The documents required for a visa change can vary depending on the visa type.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

Additionally, you might need to change your visa if it's close to expiration. /><Q: How long does the visa change process take? /><A: The duration of the visa change process varies depending on the circumstances, but finding the right documents and sponsor quickly is crucial to expedite the process. /><Q: How can Kowork help? /><A: Kowork services can assist with job searches, sponsor matching for visa changes, interview tips, and documentation support to help facilitate a smooth visa change process. /><Q: What documents are required for a visa change? /><A: The documents required for a visa change can vary depending on the visa type.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

Additionally, you might need to change your visa if it's close to expiration. /><Q: How long does the visa change process take? /><A: The duration of the visa change process varies depending on the circumstances, but finding the right documents and sponsor quickly is crucial to expedite the process. /><Q: How can Kowork help? /><A: Kowork services can assist with job searches, sponsor matching for visa changes, interview tips, and documentation support to help facilitate a smooth visa change process. /><Q: What documents are required for a visa change? /><A: The documents required for a visa change can vary depending on the visa type.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

Additionally, you might need to change your visa if it's close to expiration. /><Q: How long does the visa change process take? /><A: The duration of the visa change process varies depending on the circumstances, but finding the right documents and sponsor quickly is crucial to expedite the process. /><Q: How can Kowork help? /><A: Kowork services can assist with job searches, sponsor matching for visa changes, interview tips, and documentation support to help facilitate a smooth visa change process. /><Q: What documents are required for a visa change? /><A: The documents required for a visa change can vary depending on the visa type.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation. For instance, if you were a student and are now seeking employment, you may need to change your visa. Additionally, you might need to change your visa if it's close to expiration. /><Q: How long does the visa change process take? /><A: The duration of the visa change process varies depending on the circumstances, but finding the right documents and sponsor quickly is crucial to expedite the process. /><Q: How can Kowork help? /><A: Kowork services can assist with job searches, sponsor matching for visa changes, interview tips, and documentation support to help facilitate a smooth visa change process. /><Q: What documents are required for a visa change? /><A: The documents required for a visa change can vary depending on the visa type.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process. Visa requirements can vary from person to person, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us through our website. /><Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) /><Q: When might I need to change my visa? /><A: You might need to change your visa depending on your visa type or your situation.

Additionally, you might need to change your visa if it's close to expiration. /><Q: How long does the visa change process take? /><A: The duration of the visa change process varies depending on the circumstances, but finding the right documents and sponsor quickly is crucial to expedite the process. /><Q: How can Kowork help? /><A: Kowork services can assist with job searches, sponsor matching for visa changes, interview tips, and documentation support to help facilitate a smooth visa change process. /><Q: What documents are required for a visa change? /><A: The documents required for a visa change can vary depending on the visa type.

However, there are situations where you might need to change your visa type, especially if you hold a D-4 visa, as the process of changing to an E-7 visa can be quite complex. Let's take a look at the remarkable story of a foreign national from Indonesia who came to our Kowork. This individual managed to change their visa from D-4 to E-7 in just one month. /><1. Customer's Initial Situation /><A Customer, an Indonesian national, had already graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from his home country. After graduation, they came to South Korea to pursue Korean language education at a university language institute, holding a D-4 visa. When they approached us, they had only one month left on their D-4 visa, and changing it to an E-7 visa was imperative. /><visa korea.jpg /><2. Complex Documentation Process for D-4 to E-7 Visa Change /><Changing from a D-4 to an E-7 visa involves a much more complicated documentation process. For foreign nationals who have graduated overseas, it requires obtaining an overseas degree certificate and a work experience certificate, both of which must be notarized. Additionally, finding a company willing to sponsor your E-7 visa within a month is often a challenging task. /><3. The Role of Kowork /><Kowork often faces situations where success is not guaranteed. However, in this particular case, we recognized the individual's strengths and focused on them. With a portfolio in graphic design and Korean language proficiency at TOPIK level 5 or higher, we tailored our job matching process to target companies looking to expand into international markets. /><visa2.jpg /><4. Swift Job Matching /><Our team conducted a remarkable seven job interviews within a week, expediting the matching process. Approximately two weeks later, a company located in Gangnam, specializing in overseas investment and management consulting, expressed their intent to hire, making the visa change possible. /><5. Assistance with Visa Documentation /><We provided the necessary guidance to the company regarding the documents required for E-7 visa issuance and the correct procedure for drafting the employment contract. By collecting all the required documents from the company and the foreign national, we were able to complete the visa application just in time, even though the visa was set to expire soon. During the visa review period, the visa automatically extends even if it expires. /><6. Successful Visa Change /><One month later, the foreign national successfully obtained the E-7 visa and is now working comfortably at the company. We've heard that they're making great use of their design skills, even traveling to various countries for work. When we think about the urgency of the situation, we take pride in having played a role in their success. /><Conclusion /><Changing your visa within a short period, especially under challenging circumstances, can be a complex procedure. However, with the right support and rapid job matching, as demonstrated in this case, it is indeed possible. At our Kowork, we are committed to assisting individuals in smoothly navigating the visa change process.
